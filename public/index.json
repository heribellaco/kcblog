However, one common issue that wearers often encounter is midday fogging. In this article, we will delve into the reasons behind midday fogging with scleral lenses and explore effective solutions to ensure your visual comfort throughout the day.\nScleral lenses are a godsend for us with advanced keratoconus, I was curious about this fogging late in the day, and watched the NKCF webinar where Dr. Maria Walker of the University of Houston talked about this phenomenon and gave suggestions to improve this problem.\nUnderstanding Scleral Lenses What Are Scleral Lenses? Scleral lenses are large, gas-permeable contact lenses that rest on the sclera, the white part of the eye. They are specially designed to provide clear vision for individuals with irregular corneas or specific eye conditions, such as keratoconus.\nThe Phenomenon of Midday Fogging Why Do Scleral Lenses Fog Up? Midday fogging with scleral lenses can be a frustrating experience. Several factors contribute to this issue, including:\nThe lens is the problem: Check the lens itself, that the surface is not scratched or covered with dirt or with protein deposits, oil or soap residue or make up products.\nSecond, check that your eye is not inflamed or infected or your cornea is hurt, usually photophobia is a good indicator of this.\nThird, check your eyelids for deposits or strange secretions around the eye. Do you wake up with strange gunk or sand deposits in your eyelashes?\nIf the above is ok, the problem may be in the fluid reservoir, the space between the lens and your cornea, which can fill with debris formed of epithelial cells and neutrophils which are immune cells that point to some inflammation. There are also wax (cholesterol), lipids and triglycerides on the reservoir.\nDealing with Persistent Fogging If midday fogging remains an issue despite following the above tips, explore these advanced solutions:\n1. Scleral Lens Coatings Some specialized coatings like \u0026ldquo;HydraPeg\u0026rdquo; coating can minimize fogging by reducing moisture evaporation. Discuss this option with your eye care professional.\n2. Application adjustments Review your application technique: Fill your lens to the top with a solution and use a DMV holder parallel to the floor to avoid bubbles, and don\u0026rsquo;t press the lens to the eye. Also open your eyelids wide while inserting the lens.\n3. Try other solutions Change solutions to a higher viscosity, preservative free artificial tears or buffered solution instead of just saline solution, and try different brands.\n4. Eyelid hygene check Eyelid problems (inflammation, blepharitis, meibomian glands dysfunction or dry eye) can worsen midday fogging. Clean your eyelids and eyelashes carefully to not produce more problems and don\u0026rsquo;t touch or rub your eyes.\nConclusion Midday fogging with scleral lenses can be bothersome, but with the right strategies, you can mitigate this issue and enjoy uninterrupted clear vision. Try to touch your eyes as little as possible, also allergies can play a role in this condition. Remember to prioritize eye health and consult your eye care professional for personalized advice.\n","permalink":"https://keratoconusguide.netlify.app/posts/fogging/","tags":["Blog","Post"],"title":"Midday Fogging with Scleral Lenses"},{"categories":["New post"],"contents":" Alternative Ways to Treat and Manage Keratoconus and Visual Problems. Are you dealing with keratoconus?\nYou\u0026rsquo;re not alone - keratoconus can limit your vision and make it difficult to do things like driving and read, and it sucks.\nBut what to do?\n1) Eat healthy and supplement with B2 vitamins. Eating healthy food is the most important thing you can do for your body. Eating a balanced diet, with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, is key for optimal health.\nB2 vitamins, also known as riboflavin, are essential for healthy cell metabolism, helping your body to produce energy from the foods you eat. B2 vitamins also have antioxidant properties, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals.\n2) Avoid sleeping with your contacts. Sleeping with your contact lenses can lead to serious eye health issues, including infections and corneal ulcers. Remove contact lenses before sleep, no matter how tired you may be.\nHere are some tips to help you:\n• Set a nightly reminder on your phone or watch to take out your contacts.\n• Place your contact lens case and contact solution next to your bed so you don’t forget to take out your contacts before you go to sleep.\n*Avoid wearing your contact lenses for longer than the recommended time.\n3) Try better fitted contact lenses or scleral lenses. Getting fitted with new contact lenses can be a great way to improve your vision and your overall comfort. Whether you’re looking to switch from traditional soft lenses to something more advanced, like scleral lenses, it’s important to talk to your eye doctor about the best fit for you.\n4) Get enough sleep. Getting enough sleep is incredibly important for both physical and mental health. Sleep helps your body recover from the day, allowing you to wake up feeling refreshed and ready to start the day. It also helps your brain process information, improves your memory, and contributes to a healthy immune system.\nAvoid screens and other sources of blue light for at least an hour before bed, and try to avoid caffeine and sugary foods in the evening.\n5) Rest your eyes by closing them every once in a while, and take breaks from your contact lenses. Resting your eyes every once in a while is one of the most effective and natural ways to give them a break from the strain of staring at a digital device.\nBy closing your eyes, you allow them to rest and relax, which can prevent the development of eyestrain or other vision problems.\n6) Drink enough water and breathe deeply to relax. 7) Never rub your eyes or squint to see better. 8) Relax your neck and face and look into the distance. In general, anything that improves your health will indirectly benefit your eyes.\nThere are other ideas to implement, and you can read them in my book \u0026ldquo;The Keratoconus User-Guide\u0026rdquo; or check my blog on.\nhttps://heribertorangel.com/\nGood Luck!\nHeriberto Rangel.\nPhoto by Katherine Hanlon on Unsplash\n","permalink":"https://keratoconusguide.netlify.app/posts/holistic-approach-to-keratoconus/","tags":["Blog","Post"],"title":"The Holistic Approach to Keratoconus Treatment"},{"categories":["Keratoconus","New post"],"contents":"Article about conditions that can cause keratoconus. Introduction If you have keratoconus, it's important to learn what factors can trigger the condition. These triggers can be anything from allergies to rubbing your eyes too much. In this blog post, we'll discuss five surprising things that can cause keratoconus, how they affect your vision and how to avoid them if you're at risk of developing the condition yourself.\nEye Rubbing You might think that eye rubbing is a harmless habit, but it can actually cause some serious problems.\nFor one thing, if you rub your eyes too much or for too long (which is all too easy to do when you're tired or stressed), you can irritate the sensitive skin around your eyes and make them dry out. You may also develop a condition called blepharitis\u0026mdash;a bacterial infection of the eyelids that causes redness and irritation. In some cases, chronic eye rubbing can lead to keratoconus\u0026mdash;the loss of protein in front of your cornea (the clear front part of your eye) that results in vision loss over time.\nIf you want to keep from developing keratoconus, take steps now so that you don't have to worry about these symptoms later: stop rubbing your eyes!\nExposure to the Elements UV light. The intensity of UV rays is stronger in places like the desert, and can also be found in other areas of the world that have a high altitude or are very warm.\nSunscreens don't protect you from keratoconus. Wear polarized glasses or baseball caps in the sun.\nToo Much (or too Little) Nutrition It's not just what you eat, but how much of it. For example, too little vitamin B2 (riboflavin), which is found in leafy greens and dairy products, can help developing keratoconus. Similarly, too much vitamin C can make your cornea thinner (a big problem if you already have a thin cornea).\nThe same goes for other nutrients: too little or too much of any substance can be harmful to the eye. The key is finding a balance between what you're eating and drinking now\u0026mdash;and also making sure that any supplements or vitamins you take are safe for your eyesight as well.\nUnhealthy Habits Your lifestyle choices and habits can have a big impact on your health. If you\u0026rsquo;re already living with keratoconus, it\u0026rsquo;s important to be careful about which activities you participate in, as they may cause further damage to your cornea. Smoking, drinking alcohol and taking drugs, stress (both mental and physical), poor diet, lack of sleep and overexposure to the sun are all things that should be avoided if possible.\nIf you think one or more of these behaviors is affecting your corneas negatively but aren\u0026rsquo;t sure how best to stop them from doing so\u0026mdash;or if stopping them isn\u0026rsquo;t going to be enough\u0026mdash;it might be time for an eye exam with an optometrist or ophthalmologist who specializes in treating keratoconus patients like yourself. Checking out a list of doctors near you will help to find one who has experience diagnosing their patients' eyesight so that they can prescribe treatment plans accordingly.\u0026quot;\nSquinting Squinting is the act of closing one or both eyes to see small print, such as a restaurant menu or a street sign. It can cause eye strain and headaches if done excessively, and certainly can damage your cornea with constant abuse.\nUsing the Wrong Contact Lens Solution You\u0026rsquo;ve probably heard of contact lens solutions, but do you know what they actually do? Contact lens solutions are what keep your lenses moist and clean. This keeps your eyes healthy, which is especially important if you have keratoconus.\nThere are different types of contact lens solutions: multipurpose, sterile and disinfecting. You can also get a special solution for hard lenses\u0026mdash;like scleral lenses, these are made from a different material than soft contacts so they don\u0026rsquo;t need to be cleaned as often.\nYou may need to change your solution more often than usual if they were made by an outside manufacturer (e.g., not Bausch \u0026amp; Lomb). If this is the case, ask your optometrist or ophthalmologist how often he or she recommends changing it!\nIf you have keratoconus, you need to think back to what triggers it. If you have keratoconus, you need to think and remember your visual habits.\nSpeak with an eye doctor or optometrist. He or she can determine if there is a specific trigger for your eye condition like seasonal allergies and help you understand how to avoid that trigger.\nConclusion All in all, we hope this article has given you some insight into the many different ways keratoconus can develop. And while it\u0026rsquo;s true that not everyone with keratoconus will experience every one of these triggers, it\u0026rsquo;s important for all of us to be aware of them so we can do our best to avoid them and help prevent others from developing this condition as well.\nGood luck and Happy new Year!\n","permalink":"https://keratoconusguide.netlify.app/posts/five_surprising_things/","tags":["Blog","Post"],"title":"Five Surprising Things That Can Trigger Keratoconus"},{"categories":["New post"],"contents":"What is Keratoconus? Keratoconus is an eye disease that cause distorted vision. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to diagnose, usually starts in the adolescence, and is believed to worsen with time. The basic treatment is \u0026ldquo;contact lenses\u0026rdquo; designed for keratoconus, but other options are available like “crosslinking” to strengthen the cornea, intracorneal rings to give more structure to it, and of course a corneal transplant. Glasses or normal contact lenses don’t correct the vision satisfactorily, so activities like reading and driving become impossible. Advanced cases need specialty contact lenses like Scleral lenses.\nWhy the rub? Why rubbing your eyes? We do it when we wake up, before sleeping and when we are fatigued or stressed. Kids love to rub their eyes, the rubbing is pleasurable and has a calming effect. By rubbing the eyes, tear production increases and the pressure of eye rubbing stimulates the vagus nerve slowing the heart. Rubbing can be caused by conditions hard to assess like allergies, and can become a habit; habits are hard to observe and are mostly unconscious. In short rubbing your eyes is a risk factor to developing keratoconus.\nHypothesis The cascade hypothesis (Kenney, 2003) states that a keratoconus cornea has an abnormal level of degrading enzymes that produce a cascade of events that lead to thinning and deformation of the cornea. The genetic theory tries to find a genetic mutation for keratoconus, meaning that the disease is inherited; as of today no genetic mutations have been identified for any of the keratoconus chromosome loci, and the pattern of inheritance is less than 20 percent. Finally, the mechanical theory (Gatinel, 2016) claims that eye rubbing is the main root cause of keratoconus, by rubbing the eyes you are causing biomechanical instability to the cornea and reducing its resistance.\nOccam’s razor Have you heard the phrase? \u0026ldquo;The best explanations are the simplest ones.\u0026rdquo; This is commonly called \u0026ldquo;The occam razor.\u0026rdquo; (Wikipedia, 2021) This idea is frequently attributed to English Franciscan friar William of Ockham (c. 1287–1347), a scholastic philosopher and theologian.\nEven Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), In it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Summa Theologica\u0026rdquo; states that \u0026ldquo;it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many.\u0026rdquo;\nMost of the time we imagine that the answers are complicated and difficult. We let our biases dictate how we see a situation and react like in the past; however, it is useful to see the situation in a new light. When we do this, the answer comes to us in a moment of inspiration, we just did not see it before.\nCorrelation and Causation The phrase \u0026ldquo;correlation does not imply causation\u0026rdquo; (Wikipedia, 2021) refers to the inability to deduce a cause-and-effect relationship between two events; this events occurring together are taken to have a cause-and-effect relationship, solely based on an observed association. Statistical methods are normally used as the basis for testing hypotheses.\nWhen two things are correlated it is tempting to think they are caused directly. Eye rubbing and allergies have been linked to keratoconus by correlation.\nThe idea presented in this essay and by Dr. Damien Gatinel, is that eye rubbing and keratoconus have a direct causative link, not just a statistical correlation.\nWhat rubbing does? The shape of the cornea is a result of the balance between external and internal forces applied to the eye and the biomechanical resistance of the cornea. Rubbing the eyes increases the production of enzymes called proteases, these enzymes degrade proteins causing an attack on normal tissues and altering the corneal shape and resistance. Constant eye rubbing results in the progressive deformation and thinning that are hallmarks of the disease labeled keratoconus.\nConclusion Maybe rubbing your eyes starts the cascade of events that end with you having keratoconus. This theory is supported by the fact that more than 80% of keratoconus patients in the CLEK study (Barr, 2000) reported having rubbed their eyes vigorously. It is obvious that not all people who rub their eyes develop keratoconus, it is an idiopathic process (we don\u0026rsquo;t really know its origin). We have to take responsibility for our condition, and stop blaming a mysterious disease so we can do something about it, and not be victims anymore. I certainly rubbed my eyes when I was young, and I also nap on my belly. By recognizing how we use our eyes, we can avoid detrimental habits that will hurt us in the future.\nIf this is true, by stopping rubbing the eyes, we are truly halting the progression of keratoconus, and this is great news. Today, modern advances give us better lenses, diagnostics equipment, and treatments to aid us with this challenge than ever before.\nFor more info on these ideas and case studies visit the site Defeat Keratoconus or the doctor site below.\nwww.defeatkeratoconus.com\rwww.gatinel.com\rBarr, J.

Crosslinking with riboflavin and UV light (epi-off or epi-on).\nC) Visual rehabilitation (Contact lens and Surgery).\nVisual rehabilitation: Specialty contact lenses. Surgery includes: Intacs, Topography guided PRK (Photorefractive keratectomy), Athens protocol, CTAK (Corneal tissue addition for Keratoconus), transplant. 1.- Specialty contact lenses (I will focus on Scleral lenses)\nScleral lenses: Scleral lenses can greatly improve vision quality and can in many cases reduce or eliminate ghost images. these are hard contact lenses that bear their weight on the stronger white sclera instead of the cornea. Scleral lenses vault over and above the irregular cornea. New High Order Aberration Scleral Lenses (HOA) reduce glare and halos by a distortion visual canceling similar to audio noise-canceling like these brands:\nOvitz Ares Higher-Order Aberration Lens (https://www.ovitz.us)\nAlden Optical Zenlens™ scleral contact lenses (http://www.aldenoptical.com)\nP.S. Scleral lenses are expensive but a worthing investment.\nMore info about Scleral lenses (https://sclerallens.org/)\n2.- Surgery options: Some can be used simultaneously depending on many factors and not all doctors use them.\nIntacs or Ferrara rings.- Are small pieces of plastic that are inserted in the cornea periphery to provide better support and reduce refraction errors. Topography guided PRK, alters corneal curvature with Alcon EX500 laser to improve the topography to \u0026ldquo;smooth the hills and mountains\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;raise\u0026rdquo; the flatter parts of the cornea. By improving the shape of the cornea, in many cases, glare, halo, and ghost images are reduced. Athens protocol: Topo PRK \u0026amp; Crosslinking AKA “Athens protocol”: First proposed by Dr. Kanellopoulos, if you combine topography-guided PRK with CXL you can improve the shape and in turn the vision of the patient while simultaneously halting the progression of the disease. Kanellopoulos conducted a study a few years ago. He performed sequential and simultaneous procedures. In sequential, you crosslink first, allow the eye to heal, then perform Topo-PRK. In simultaneous, you perform Topo-PRK then immediately crosslink. He found both were successful, however, the simultaneous group outperformed the sequential group. CTAK (Corneal tissue addition for Keratoconus) inserts corneal tissue similarly to how Intacs are inserted. Corneal Transplant: Corneal transplants can help but in many cases, the transplant itself will have irregular astigmatism that can create higher-order aberrations that cause ghost images/glare/halo, so you will need some form of correction.

Certainly, we that handles contact lens are accustomed to cleaning and washing our hands very thoroughly to avoid coronavirus eye symptoms.\nYoung adult contact lens wearers have been reported to be more likely to develop eye infections and more likely to have poor contact lens hygiene practices. In short, several risk factors have been identified, including sleeping in lenses, exposing lenses to water, not adhering to replacement schedules, and reusing disinfecting solutions.\nCoronavirus eye symptoms This virus can infect us through our eye’s angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ACE-2 receptors and cause problems. On the other hand, people have reported viral infections of the eyes called \u0026ldquo;pinkeye\u0026rdquo; since the beginning of the year. This infection is not severe, it appears that the eye path won’t get you a heavy corona virus case like if you inhaled the droplets by your nose.\nThere is a strong possibility the virus may contaminate the ocular surface via respiratory droplets after coughing, sneezing, and hand-to-eye contact.

The Chinese have recorded the points of the circulation of energy (qi), over the whole body for thousands of years, and therefore can apply needles to various places to treat hundreds of conditions. Acupuncture remains a secure way of balancing your emotions and relaxing your body.\nIt produces no side effects and is especially effective in aiding the relaxation response. Acupuncture is used to treat eye conditions like conjunctivitis, myopia (especially at the beginning), diabetic retinopathy, retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, retinal detachment, and glaucoma.\nKeratoconus is not treated with acupuncture; however, we with keratoconus suffer other eye conditions like – infections, dry eyes, macular degeneration, glaucoma, floaters, and cataracts. You need a practitioner with experience in treating eye diseases with acupuncture, they exist and generally, their treatments are holistic in nature using massage, herbs, homeopathy, supplements, and nutrition.\nAcupuncture for eyes Acupuncture puts needles in places far away to the eyes based on the energy meridians involved, on the pattern discrimination, and on the organs out of balance. These are points generally in liver and gallbladder meridians, especially in the legs, torso, and scalp. In the Chinese view, the liver fulfills an increasingly prominent role in nurturing the eyes. It is the acupuncturist’s job to detect the points in your body and stimulate them with needles without injuring you or any of your organs. There are different sorts of needles, insertion techniques, insertion angles, and deepness used at any particular point.\nAcupuncture points nomenclature Acupuncture points have a nomenclature aside from their Chinese names using the main organ meridian the point influences. Lung Meridian is abbreviated – (LU) in ascending number sequence LU1(Zhongfu), LU2, LU3… LU11(Shaoshang). The points are selected with care and taking into consideration the zang-fu organ imbalance, the five elements relationships within them, the eight indicators and the meridians involved, for more info on Traditional Chinese Medicine read Chinese Herbal Formulas\nFictional Acupuncture treatment for Keratoconus First, a Traditional Chinese Doctor will analyze your disease symptoms and will arrive at a pattern diagnosis. Then decide on a regimen. In acupuncture as the therapy advances the symptoms change, so the doctor modifies the treatment accordingly.\nChinese Pattern Diagnosed: Liver and blood stagnation, yin deficiency of lung and kidney.\nStagnation of liver qi points selected: LR14, LR3, GB34: LR-liver, GB-Gallbladder.\nNourish qi and blood points: ST38, SP6: ST-Stomach, SP-Spleen.\nReinforce liver and kidney yin points: LR3, KI3, BL18, BL23: KI-Kidney, BL-Bladder.\nStrengthen lung qi points: LU9, SP3, LI11, BL13 (remember lung is related to the cornea): LU-Lung, LI-Large Intestine.\nThere is a logic behind the treatment. Some points are stimulated with needles or with moxibustion*, you need an acupuncturist with experience in these points. The duration of the therapy is usually half an hour three times a week, and you will be alone relaxing in a room.\n*****Application of heat\nAcupuncture for eyes practitioners… i know of: UK , Bath: Julian Scott\nDenmark : Boel family\nUSA , NJ : Andy Rosenfarb\nUSA , Bentonville Arkansas : Lizbeth Ryan\nMexico , Mexico City : Luo Lijuan\nThere must be a lot many in mainland China, Japan, and Korea if you are there, but the language is sometimes an obstacle for us.\nConclusion Acupuncture is safe, has no side effects, and can help you with many conditions like general pain or even high blood pressure. It can complement your regular medical therapy and excellent nutrition. It is a well-accepted treatment for people of all ages, kids and even pets, it is fun and makes you feel great.\nWith all this pandemic around, I don’t worry much about having an acupuncture treatment since you are basically alone and relaxing after the needles are inserted in you.\nSo what do you think?\nIf you liked this post, please leave a comment or share it on social.\nThank you and Good luck!\nHeriberto R.\nHi, I love to improve myself and others.

To believe we have a condition just by chance, even when it’s accurate doesn’t help us. The appropriate attitude is to accept what you can change and what you can’t, like the famous alcoholics anonymous quote. You will handle the situation, you have the power to change.\nFacing challenges is an integral part of taking action, we have a choice over our health. Note what you can control and deal with in life by doing the best with what you have, know where you are. I like to adopt an open-minded attitude when dealing with health issues because, in reality, nobody knows what is going on, even your doctor.\nYour body possesses an intelligence of millions of years and adapts to the circumstances beautifully. If this was not the case, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be here at all. The disease is incredibly complex, and it\u0026rsquo;s problematic to discover a cause, and address that issue is hard.\nKeratoconus what to do to solve this? There is no fight to be fought, just acceptance and action, we have not an enemy, just our body and its intelligence. It is pleasant to believe that we can dominate the natural world, and in a way, human beings have been undertaking that for centuries. Civilization has been marked by the advance in science, art, and culture for the most part of history.\nThe idea of an enemy causing our problems can be traced back to the germ disease theory by Luis Pasteur; that theory has marked how we think about disease and started the let’s fight against an enemy attitude. Now we know that we have more bacteria in our bodies than healthy cells, not all organisms are trying to kill us, but help us in areas like digestion and nutrition. If we eliminate these bacteria, we will probably die. We are dancing with nature in an interchange compared to a beautiful symphony, and we need to learn to respect this natural order or we will pay the price.\nWhat to do about your keratoconus? You will handle whatever, comes your way. This could be contact lenses, cross-linking or any other treatment recommended by your doctor. Invest in your health and vision, travel if necessary to get this challenge controlled. Try getting your contact lenses covered by insurance, but if not, pay them yourself.\nTheories \u0026amp; Ideas Cascade\u0026rsquo;s hypothesis concludes that abnormal levels of degradation enzymes are the cause of keratoconus. These enzymes generate apoptosis (cell death), alter corneal thickness and shape, and cause heavy astigmatism and myopia. The eye rubbing theory believes that by rubbing our eyes we are generating these same degradation enzymes; causing the thinning of the cornea that is a characteristic of keratoconus.\nBasic Treatment To clarify, the basic treatment of keratoconus are contact lenses designed for keratoconus corneas. Essentially, there are three types: corneal lenses, hybrid lenses, and scleral lenses. We have more options to handle this condition than ever, there is no cure, but keratoconus can be managed successfully. Contact lenses might be needed to achieve an acceptable vision. Scleral contact lenses_ are good to handle advanced cases and can be thought of as the last resort before a transplant. Scleral are bigger than regular corneal lenses, they get support on the white part of your eye called the sclera, producing a vault for your cornea filled with solution and tears. Scleral\u0026rsquo;s are an extremely reliable option for people that can’t handle other types of lenses.\nOther treatments In recent years treatments like cross-linking and intra-corneal rings have been created, however, these procedures are more invasive. Cross-linking halts the progression of the disease by utilizing ultraviolet light and riboflavin drops to forge bonds on the cornea collagen fibers. By hardening these fibers, it is declared to improve visual acuity on most patients. Time is required to see if it worked; you will likely need contact lenses anyway to correct your vision. Corneal rings are plastic rings that are introduced in the corneal stroma to provide support and reduce the front bulging; they have to be implanted surgically but can be withdrawn if they don\u0026rsquo;t work.\nWhy is good to improve in other areas Keratoconus has to do as much with your habits as with your DNA. You express the preconditions to disease by your actions, by what you eat, and how you operate your body. We arrived at the fundamental point of this article. There needs to be awareness, to prevent the detriment of your health.\nNobody likes been told that their elevated blood pressure, diabetes, and I don’t know what else is caused by themselves. It is hard to confront the possibility that we are harming ourselves, It is far easier to blame a bug or a disease. We tend to want to get rid of disease as if it was something that happened to us, not something that we have a part in it.\nThis way of thinking requires discovering a cure that will get rid of the problem, without attending to the causes of illness. You can do much more than getting contact lenses, you can shift attention to how you have lived and improve in other areas. Nutrition, sleep, and cleaning habits are always important. Identify your part on the problem, not to take the blame, but to gain the leverage to improve the situation. By focusing on what you can improve, you can take control of your condition.\nGood Attitude A good attitude enables you to be less of a complainer, and more of an action-oriented guy. You try new things and feel better even when things get rough. It can be mentioned that your thinking and attitude will determine how your condition affects your life. Belief and attitude are cousins, they aid you to achieve far greater things. With the appropriate attitude, you won’t be a victim and will have the power to accept this challenge.\nConclusion I like the feeling I am doing something for myself, even if it is cleaning my room or throwing the trash. By investing in my health, I can experiment with what works for me, everyone is different. Listen with caution but adopt an adventurous attitude. Always try new things like rare foods, unfamiliar music, and alter the route you take every day. Only by being persistent, you will see what works to aid you. Don’t complain, you need a little suffering before crossing that threshold and taking charge of your vision and life\u0026hellip;\nWhat do you think?

New designs and materials make these lenses better every day and with proper management, you can adapt to them quickly. If you try them, Scleral lenses are probably the last option for us with advanced keratoconus, before the use of other more drastic measures.\nCaracteristics Sclerals are different than corneal lenses in some aspects. The insertion and removing procedure is more complicated, especially the removing, and the eye has to adapt to the lens anyway, this lenses are bigger than corneal lenses and they get support in the white part of your eye called the Sclera. You never had any object touching this area, so you must adapt to that.\nProblems and Advantages Many people say that sclerals get foggy issues, I have never had that problem. In my experience, sclerals are a life-saving option but are different than corneal lenses.\nProbably they are the last option besides piggy-backing to other surgical procedures. It is true that scleral lenses are not as good in clarity as very good fitted corneal lenses, but the comfort they provide is very good and once you get used to them and to the removal you will be glad you have them.\nGet more info at:\nScleral Lens Education Society\nConclusion Scleral lenses last years with proper management and cleaning. In the end, get a good pair of them. Adapt little by little, follow your routine of insertion, removal, and cleaning.

In short, we all have had these experiences, certainly, keratoconus is a very rare condition and few people have heard about it.\nIt is that rare that even students of ophthalmology don\u0026rsquo;t know many keratoconus patients. It has a prevalence of about 1 in 2000 people, with no particular predilection for race or gender. This means that in a City of 1 million persons, only 500 might have the condition, but I believe that only about 100 will be properly diagnosed with advanced cases.\nWhen does Keratoconus start? One of the rare facts about keratoconus is that almost always starts in our teen years. As a result, there is no way of knowing when this condition really starts, but probably by when you are diagnosed, you have had it for years. However, your symptoms were so little that you didn\u0026rsquo;t notice anything wrong with your vision.\nI remember the allergies and the pleasure when you rub your eyes. It was a time in my life when I was studying hard and my vision deteriorated over this time period. I also remember to always look to close objects, for instance to the floor when I walked, I guess I was a little self-conscious regarding my visual habits.\nAnother thing that I did was squinting a lot to try to see the small letters. It is a coping mechanism to try to see but it means that you don\u0026rsquo;t see well with your current prescription and need to go see your ophthalmologist.\nConclusion A genetic disease The idea that keratoconus is genetic is losing traction. Have you seen a fat lady with a fat dog? the dog is fat because the owner gives him too much food, not because the dog is genetically susceptible to being fat.\nThere are many factors causing our problem; the disease is multi-factorial and everything helps or deteriorates your vision. Most importantly we need to be resilient and get the best help we can without losing the final objective of living with keratoconus.\nWhat do you think?\nif you liked this post leave a comment, sign below, or share it.\nThank you and Good luck!\nHeriberto R.\nHi, I love to improve myself and others.

What if we carry out a Keratoconus natural treatment by consuming riboflavin (vitamin B-2) orally and getting exposure to infrared sunlight by going outdoors? If you are recently diagnosed this could help.\nUsually, it takes about a year to determine if your keratoconus is getting worse. Your doctor will assess changes in values from tests such as the Sim\u0026rsquo;k values or a reduction in cornea thickness by comparing your recent test results with previous ones. Of course, this assessment depends on various factors, so feel free to ask questions and carefully consider your choices. If you\u0026rsquo;ve been recently diagnosed, your doctor will likely recommend cross-linking to you.\nKeratoconus usually progresses slowly, find the facts first, you have time! That is why you need to discover the facts and not rush to try to get rid of the problem with your first diagnosis. Start with specialty contact lenses and adapt to them, probably you will require them anyway. Later when you are sure of the progression get the cross-linking.\nKeratoconus treatment: Natural Cross-linking with Sun Light A keratoconus natural treatment cross-linking small prospective study sponsored by the University of Missouri-Columbia, including 24 patients with keratoconus was started on a trial of oral riboflavin and 15 minutes of natural sunlight exposure daily for 6 months. These patients reported no adverse effects and as a result, preliminary tests showed corneal stabilization and/or corneal flattening in all 7 patients.\nUV light stimulates riboflavin to form new bonds (cross-links) between the cornea\u0026rsquo;s connective tissue, giving the cornea additional strength to maintain its shape and prevent the need for transplantation. This is a good option if you are not in a hurry or if your insurance won\u0026rsquo;t cover the procedure.\nThe cost of epi-off cross-linking treatment is about $2,500 to $3,500 and is invasive because they remove the top layer of the cornea and it takes from 3 to 6 months to stabilize the vision afterward.\nKeratoconus treatment with vitamins: How to do it? \u0026ldquo;Patients will take 400 mg dietary riboflavin per day and go outside without sunglasses or contacts for 15 minutes per day to evaluate the effects of riboflavin B2 and natural UV light from sun exposure.\u0026rdquo;\nKeratoconus natural treatment: What do you need? Dietary Supplement: Dietary riboflavin is vitamin B2.\nThe Study confirms \u0026ldquo;No adverse effects have ever been reported with high-dose dietary riboflavin supplements. The results of this preliminary trial are remarkable\u0026rdquo;. In conclusion, B2 has been shown to be safe in children in the treatment of migraines at doses of 400 mg per day*. There are no known documented side effects; always talk to your doctor if you want to try this, get informed if you want to do it, and try to improve your nutrition and hydrate.\nMost importantly: It is good to change your visual habits, so you don’t damage your eyes anymore. For more ideas read my book \u0026ldquo;Keratoconus User-Guide\u0026rdquo; a Health guide for people with keratoconus, available on Amazon.\nIn short, If you can not afford the cross-linking procedure or are not progressing much you could try this hack.\nSource: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier (NCT number): NCT03095235.\n*Schoenen, J., Lenaerts, M., \u0026amp; Bastings, E.

This means that eating too much food is bad for you, of course, we are not rats; but remember that digestion requires that you spend energy (enzymes) processing the food you eat.\nWhat to do You can reduce the calories you consume or you can fast certainly calorie reduction can help to reduce the oxidative damage from free radicals and improve the enzymatic protection your cells have.\nHowever, do you know your caloric requirements? First, It is easy to calculate your caloric requirements, you just need to know five things, your age (years), sex (male, female), height (centimeters), weight (kilograms), and your approximate activity level.\nCaloric restriction formulas The next formula is called the Harris-Benedict formula for the scientists that created it. In conclusion, by calculating your basal metabolic rest rate you will know how much energy your body requires daily. Multiply this for your activity level and finally, you will know how many calories your body needs to maintain your weight.\nHarris-Benedict formulas BMR=basal metabolic rate\nFor Men\nBMR=66.4730+(13.7516*weight)+(5.0033*height)-(6.7550*age)\nFor Woman\nBMR=655.0955+(9.5634*weight)+(1.8496*height)-(4.6756*age)\nNow multiply this BMR for the activity chart level number below according to with your exercise level to get your daily metabolic expenditure in kilocalories.\nExercise Daily Caloric Expenditure Little or no exercise DCE=BMRx1.2 Light exercise (1 days a week) DCE=BMRx1.375 Moderate exercise (3 days a week) DCE=BMRx1.55 Strong exercise (6-7 days a week) DCE=BMRx1.725 Very strong exercise : DCE=BMRx1.9 Most importantly, men need more calories than a woman, even a reduction of 500 calories is enough to have a calorie reduction that can benefit your health.\nBibliography:\n[1] Effect of Restricted Feeding Upon\nAging and Chronic Diseases in\nRats and Dogs*\nC.

Keratoconus is basically a conical cornea. The cornea is a lens that focuses the light from our environment into the retina in the back of your eyes. If your cornea shape is altered, this will cause patterns of astigmatism and myopia hard to correct with glasses.\nHow is keratoconus treated? Gas-permeable contact lenses are the first option for someone with keratoconus. Today there are great variety of specialty contact lenses to fit the keratoconus cornea (corneal, scleral, hybrid). The other treatments are more invasive and expensive like crosslinking (to stop progression), intacts (flatten the cornea), or transplant (worst case scenario), and you will probably still need contact lenses.\nsee the post keratoconus overview\nWhat to do about it? First: Invest in your vision\nGet Informed of your options: go to the best doctor you can afford and buy the best contact lenses you can. This will help you go back to your life but will also help your corneas not to suffer.\nSecond: Change your diet*\nThe most important aspect you have control over is your diet. In conclusion, what you eat, in what quantities and how nutritious is your food is the most important thing to help you.\nThird: Cleanse\nBy cleansing, you are improving your body conditions so it works as it should. A body rid of toxins can work in a more efficient manner and “probably” more protection and nutrients reach your eyes.\nFourth: Consciousness\nRealize what you do and how you use your eyes, meanwhile be in the present, watch how you feel your neck and shoulders and how you breathe. Open your eyes wide and look into the distance, learn to relax your face muscles.\nFifth: Be positive and Proactive\nThink you can achieve whatever you put your mind to. Don’t let negative or pessimistic ideas, attitudes, or people distract you from your goal. If you are positive you will see things in a clearer way and this will help you get rid of the victim mentality.\nSixth: Take small steps\nDon’t try to get rid of the problem because you won’t. Any treatment is supposed to stop the progression or improve your vision but has consequences.\n*Try to reduce all processed grain foods to a minimum, go gluten-free if you can, and get rid of sugar, sodas, canned fruit, and sugary juices and stop smoking.\nConclusion keratoconus is “believed” to be a degenerative condition. For most of us, the progression stops with age, however It is supposed to get worse with time; It is found in approximately 1 in 2000 people.\nMany people have form fruste keratoconus (early keratoconus), but don’t know it because they can see with the lenses they use, so when the disease starts, and where it ends?\nMy idea is that everything you do can worse or improve your condition. The causes might be in us but we have also the power to change bad habits and improve in other areas. I believe that any degenerative condition can be improved by nutritional intervention, it may not cure you but can help you to have better health.\nBeing a victim and blaming your bad luck is not going to help you, but being proactive and taking small steps toward a healthier way of living will improve your life.\nGetting glasses or contacts is not enough. Why settle for less when you can do many things and change many attitudes that are derogatory to your well-being?\nThanks for your interest and Good Luck.\nHeriberto R.\nHi, I love to improve myself and others.

Is a condition of the cornea; the cornea is a lens whose primary function is to focus the light rays from our environment the retina in the back of our eye. In the retina, there are receptors called rods and cones that send information about light and color through the optical nerve to the brain.\nIn the brain, this information is processed and an image is formed, so in reality, we see with our eyes and with our brain. Rods handle the peripheral vision, the vision in low light conditions and cones handle mostly color and detail.\nThe keratoconus cornea bulges forward and instead of spherical becomes like a cone and therefore the name keratoconus. This bulging produces distorted patterns of light that become heavy myopia and astigmatism (refraction error).\nThe Cornea The cornea is one of the most important parts of the eye, if everything is right with your eyes, but your corneas are damaged, you won’t see very well. The cornea is the transparent part of the sclera (the white part), that allows the light rays to enter the eye to be able to see.\nYou can think of the cornea as the lens of a camera. And it is this important function that people with keratoconus have problems with.\nThe cornea even though it has no blood vessels except at its margin, is nourished from within the eye and from the outside by the oxygen in the air we breathe.\nCornea layers Corneal Epithelium (outer part) Bowman’s layer Corneal Stroma (90% of the corneal thickness), Descemet’s membrane Corneal Endothelium (innermost part) From within the eye, the cornea receives nutrients from the aqueous humor, this is replenished continually and helps maintain the cornea’s convex shape by intraocular pressure.\nThe aqueous humor is a filtrate of blood and can be thought of as clear blood.1\nEven though aqueous humor contains no red blood cells and little protein, it carries oxygen and nutrients to the posterior cornea, lens, and iris, especially ascorbate (vitamin C) which has antioxidant properties.\nWhat causes keratoconus? It is not known what causes keratoconus: there is a belief that it has a genetic origin because people of the same family with keratoconus have been reported, or that it is secondary to some disease process.\nKeratoconus Types of cones Nipple cone. - small and centrally located.\nOval cone. - large in size between 5 and 6 mm.\nGlobus cone. - keratoglobus, more than 6mm and hard to fit.\nContact Lenses Contact lenses work by replacing the irregular surface of the cornea with the more correct shape of the lens so that the light rays are properly focused. In the preliminary stages of the disease, the refraction error can be corrected with glasses or soft contact lenses. Later with increased astigmatism, toric soft contact lenses work for a while, but gradually rigid permeable gas contact lenses (RGP’s) are necessary to correct the distorted cornea and obtain acceptable vision.\n1 David R.

If your lens fall to the floor don’t move, try to guess where they are, stay calm and carefully back up from where you are and get the lamp.\nIf you put them in the bath do realize that the lens may fall to the sink or the floor so be careful with that, that happened to me once and have to dismantle the sink, luckily I found the lens.\nAlways remove the same lens first, put it in the case and fill it with the solution. Then remove the other lens and do the same. It is always a good idea to put a re-wetting drop on each eye before attempting to remove the contact.\nHow do I insert scleral contact lenses Before insertion put the lens on your hand and empty the over-night solution over the lens and then with your finger gently rub the inside surface of the lens to remove protein buildup; after that drop, the old solution, wash the lens with clean water or re-wetting solution, put 3-4 drops of new solution and then insert the lens.\nThere are different ways to do this, put the lens in your index finger and add 3-4 drops of a new solution, this requires balance, and with my other hands open the eyelids gently and insert the lens.\nMany times I altered this order and almost lost a lens or put both lenses together in the same side of the case, this happens when you arrive late and are tired, the next morning you freak out because you don’t find a lens in the case.\nIt is easy to screw up if you are thinking about a problem or are in a hurry, you need to be focused on the routine and do it with calmness.\nNever put the lenses in tap water unless it is an emergency and always check the lens before insertion, sometimes there are particles, dry solution, or eyelashes inside that could irritate you, or the lens is broken or dirty with protein buildup.\nHow long will it take? If you repeat the routine daily, soon will become automatic and you will get better at inserting and removing the lens. It usually takes about 21 days\nTo get used to the routine, do the same thing every day and remember to be always concentrated and calmed while putting or removing your contacts.\nGood Luck!\nHeriberto R.\nJoin #HealthyEyes news\u0026hellip; and Get info fast ","permalink":"https://keratoconusguide.netlify.app/posts/how-to-create-a-contacts-routine/","tags":["Blog","Post","Old"],"title":"How to create a contacts routine"},{"categories":["therapy"],"contents":"You can think of health as a state of \u0026ldquo;harmony\u0026rdquo; between the different parts of yourself.

This guided meditation is based in a Nero-Linguistic Programming (NLP) strategy discovered by studying the creative thinking process of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and applied it to help cure disease. This strategy is taken from Robert Dilts excellent book *Beliefs*.\nThis is a guided meditation which means you are going to listen to my voice, relax and imagine a color you like, a smell you adore, and also a sound that attracts you.\nHow to make visualization work Visualization is a powerful tool in sports and business, people that have success visualizing do the following:\nKnow what they want. Get in a relaxed state. Visualize getting what they want in a full rich experience (images, sounds, smells, and feelings). Believe and expect to get it. Think they deserve it. You must believe it will work and imagine fully associated (your point of view), images of you achieving your goal, in \u0026ldquo;the first person\u0026rdquo;. Associated pictures are bigger and more exciting than dissociated ones. There is no right or wrong way of doing it, it is all in your imagination, the most important part is to relax and focus on your breathing, you may fall asleep while doing it, that is fine.\nVisualizing is just focusing on a part of your body, for instance, your eyes, and imagining they are shining with a bright color, you can imagine the color intensifying and making a sound.\nI recommend trying this at the end of the day, it will help you relax before sleeping. You can listen to this recording when you want to relax; please remove your contacts.\nFor color, I usually pick a clear blue color and the sound is a buzzing energy sound or the rolling of the ocean, the smell I use can be lavender or fresh grass. You can use anything that you like even classical music, the sound of rain or a Beatles song. Takes time to improve at this, but it is a good practice and can help you learn to relax and probably to get you interested in learning meditation later.\nHealthy Eyes Healing Meditation\rBibliography *Dilts, Robert.

Regular apple juice is fine.\n2.- On the six-day ideally, on a Saturday: Drink the last liter of apple juice in the morning, eat a very light meal (fruit and rice for example), early like 1 pm and in the afternoon do the following:\nAdd 4 tablespoons of Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate), to three 8 oz cups of water.\nMix well, and you will get \u0026ldquo;four\u0026rdquo; 6 oz portions (3/4 cup).\nDrink your first portion early afternoon between 6 and 7 pm.\nDrink your second portion two hours later.\n3.- Before bed at night (The Flush).\nSqueeze some grapefruits to get 3/4 glass of juice and add 1/2 cup of olive oil.\nShake the juice/oil until blended in a jar.\nDrink the oil mixture and go to bed immediately, around 10 pm. Close your nose while drinking this because the taste is horrendous.\nThe next day early drink your third 6oz portion of diluted Epsom salt.\nTwo hours later drink the last 6oz portion.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it, don\u0026rsquo;t go out on Sunday and stay close to the bath. This is because Epsom salt\nis a kind of laxative.\nIf you want get an enema to help get out the stones. but I think most of them come out by themselves.\nIf you are adventureous you can try this to see if it works. Dont be scared, purging yourself with oil is an old tradition lost in the modern world.\n*Timeless Secrets of Health and Rejuvenation, Andreas Moritz 2009.\nJoin email list! and Get information fast\u0026hellip; ","permalink":"https://keratoconusguide.netlify.app/blog/liver-cleanse/","tags":["Blog","Post","Old"],"title":"How to Liver Cleanse"},{"categories":["Diagnosis"],"contents":"Test for Nutrient Deficiencies How do you know if you have a nutrient deficiency?

When we are making \u0026ldquo;affirmations for health\u0026rdquo; we are doing what everyone does but we are doing it consciously and with a goal in mind. We all lie to ourself\u0026rsquo;s and others, we exaggerate our capacity and diminish the capacity of our competition at the same time. We do this because it is important to our survival.\nThe Unconscious In its book, Psychocybernetics Maxwell Maltz tells us that the unconscious has a goal-seeking mechanism and that it must be fed a goal through imagination to try to strive for it.\nThat is exactly what we do when we make affirmations, we relax and repeat in a loud voice or internally or listen or in writing what we want to achieve.\nAffirmations must be personal, this means that you can repeat somebody else affirmations, but to be more effective you have to adapt them to your situation and goals. Affirmations must be repeated with faith.\nIn the book \u0026ldquo;Think and grow rich\u0026rdquo; Napoleon hill recommends repeating what you desire with emotion, this is one the most important ingredients of achieving your goals.\nHow to make your own affirmations First, they need to be repeated in the present tense as if they were real and you had them already. Second, they need to be expressed as positives, the unconscious mind doesn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026quot; process negatives. Affirmations need to be personal \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo;, important to you, specific and clear. Finally, you have to relax your body and breath, with no distractions and repeat them with faith as if they were true. If you think about it, this is essentially what people call \u0026ldquo;praying\u0026rdquo; in many religions. You are stating what you want, relaxing closing your eyes, and mixing it with faith that God will help you achieve your desire. It is actually uncanny how this works sometimes.\n\u0026ldquo;I eat healthy food\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;I am calm and relaxed\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;I walk every day\u0026rdquo; these examples work. \u0026quot; I don\u0026rsquo;t smoke anymore\u0026quot; is an affirmation that is not correct, or \u0026ldquo;I am going to lose weight\u0026rdquo; is stated in the future, \u0026quot; I will change the world\u0026quot; is not very specific and in the future tense.\nIf you want to have more impact you can repeat the affirmation to yourself, then in the second person and then in the third person. Like this \u0026ldquo;I am extraordinary\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;you are extraordinary\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;beto is extraordinary\u0026rdquo;.\nSo think about what you want to see in your world and write some affirmations, make reading them a habit, just for five minutes in the morning or when you can do them.\nJoin email list! and Get information fast\u0026hellip; We won\u0026rsquo;t send you spam.

First, calm down, relax and search for a specialist and contact lens fitter with keratoconus experience. If it is the first time of your diagnosis, your Keratoconus might be not so advanced.\nThe first option treatment for someone with keratoconus is \u0026ldquo;specialty contact lenses\u0026rdquo;. There are many options and they can help you for years.\nIf you are very young in your teens and very advanced you might consider cross-linking, however, you must anyway first try to handle it with keratoconus contact lenses (Rose-K, Synergeyes, Sclerals lens..etc).\nHelpful websites and associations National Keratoconus Foundation- This is all you need for information. Referrals to doctors anywhere in the world and an online forum and newsletter. Order the \u0026ldquo;What is Keratoconus\u0026rdquo; booklet. My sincere appreciation to Kathy Warren\u0026rsquo;s help for many years.\nhttps://www.nkcf.org\nKeratoconus Group- Large support community for keratoconus patients with lots of social media followers and blog.\nhttps://www.keratoconusgroup.org How to cope with it\nDon\u0026rsquo;t panic about trying to solve this with advanced treatments to get rid of the problem right away. Find a good doctor or fitter and invest first in a good pair of specialty contact lenses and adapt to them.\nAsk your doctor or many doctors your options for treatments (Contacts, Cross-linking, rings etc..) and costs. You might need to travel to another city or country to do this.\nYou need to be resilient, it will take time to adjust to the lenses but you can do it, take baby steps. I strongly suggest first adapt to contact lenses and if that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work look for the other options.\nChange your diet and hydrate. Have a routine for cleansing and removing your lenses and make it a habit. Use brands of solutions as recommended by your doctor. Stop rubbing your eyes and stop squinting.\nlooking at the future\u0026hellip;\nYou will handle this, it is not that hard, trust in your body and relax.

They represent all that we eat. Most foods have nutrients in different proportions. For example, a banana has mostly carbohydrates and very little protein and fiber, a steak has mostly protein and fat.\nIt is not necessary to find out what foods have protein or fat, most fruits and vegetables have some protein and carbohydrates and also lots of micro-nutrients, I recommend a diet with lots of green vegetables like spinach and broccoli, some grains and seeds for the essential fatty acids and as little animal protein as possible. Food largely depends on your personal habits and preferences. Some people love refined carbohydrates like pasta and pizza. I think is better to reduce the number of foods that are highly processed or refined.\nNutrients definition/Carbohydrates White bread and pasta tend to have a high glycemic load, they are absorbed very quickly by your body and cause spikes in your insulin production. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps to move the energy (glucose) to the cells of your body. Too much insulin or too little is very dangerous to your eyes. So it is better to consume whole grain pasta and bread instead of the plain white flour variety.\nEssential Fatty Acids It is good that you consume essential omega 3 fatty acids in the form of ground flax-seed with your cereal or fruit and add some nuts and seeds to your diet, they can be added to your salad or shake in the morning. Another good source of polyunsaturated fatty acids are seeds like chia or sunflower seeds, almonds, pecans, and almost all nuts. Try to get them raw, unsalted, and not roasted since this reduces their nutritional value.\nYou can soak the almonds in the water for a few hours to remove the skins before eating them, this makes them easier to digest.\nMicro-nutrients Micro-nutrients are vitamins and minerals, they are required for different purposes and generally obtained from food. Since we are constantly exposed to all types of toxins, pesticides, chemical fertilizers, and food additives, it is a good idea to know a bit about the vitamins and minerals that can help to defend us against disease.\nRead my post on: Vitamin \u0026amp; mineral supplements.\nConclusion In short, you have a full arsenal of nutrients in all the vegetables and fruit that you consume and it is just a case of having a varied diet and not abusing any group too much.\nHi, I love to improve myself and others.

You need fresh ingredients and a self-made vinaigrette with a little oil.\nSo a healthy smoothie is a very easy option to get all that nutrients in liquid form and has all that fiber that is so good for your digestion. A smoothie is very fulfilling I can easily substitute one meal with a smoothie.\nYou can use your regular blender no need to buy an expensive one.\nFirst the ingredients: Spinach, Kale, Celery, Carrot, Avocado, Tomato, Banana, Apple, Blueberries, and Flax-seed or sunflower seeds.\nDepending on where you get your produce just wash it and disinfect it. Especially spinach, celery, and kale.\nPut everything in the blender.\nAdd 2-3 cups of water or one cup of almond or rice milk and two of water.\nBlend.\nIf it is too dense for you just add more water.\nIt certainly looks bad, but I assure you the taste is actually great.\nIf you have a sweet tooth you can add little molasses, stevia, honey or more bananas or even strawberries to taste.\nEnjoy.\nPS. Finally, depending on your blender vase size, experiment with the portions of vegetables, the green ones take less space and the blueberries are so small that disappear in the mix.\nJoin email list! and Get information fast\u0026hellip; We won\u0026rsquo;t send you spam.

From what you do, to how you choose what you buy. *Beliefs are filters that tell you what to look for, and it is important to have the correct beliefs so they support you in your quest for what you want.\nBeliefs come in various forms there are beliefs about who you are, about what things mean, and about causes and effects. Beliefs can become self-fulfilling prophecies. It is so easy to fall into the victim mentality. The truth is that you can choose to be proactive with your health, you can get the best help you can, and also do little routines that will help you.\nMost of all you need belief to sustain this effort since there is no warranty that any of this will work. you need to regain faith in your own body and let him do the repair work.\n“One of the biggest obstacles we face is the belief that the eyes can not improve only get worse”.\nBeliefs and habits can be changed. Since a new belief will cause us to act differently, we will improve in that area affected by the new beliefs we have.\nResistance to Change You need to recognize what beliefs you have in different areas. Also you need to pay the price for change. Many people want to change but this doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, there will always be resistance to change, resistance works that way. Resistance is that little voice in your head that doesn\u0026rsquo;t want you to grow, always a victim of bad luck. Trust in yourself and do what you feel is right to improve.\nHabits We believe we choose most of our actions but in reality, they are an accumulation of habits. This is true for our daily routines. That is something we need to be aware of in case we are doing something detrimental to our vision. Bad habits like squinting and not cleaning properly your contacts can impact your vision and comfort, we need to realize that we can improve our vision by improving our habits.\nHabits are automatic and allow us to ride a bike or make a phone call without having to learn how to do it every time. Neurology can be overridden with effort, but we must make a conscious effort to do that change. Once the new habit is in place the old one diminishes its influence in our behavior. It never vanishes completely, waiting for a moment of weakness to surfacing back. This moment usually happens when a personal crisis like unemployment appears.\nHabits are important because we want to get used to a routine with our lenses, we want to thoroughly clean and disinfect our contacts. Pay attention to any discomfort, redness or discharge in our eyes or eyelids.\nBad vision habits are difficult to stop because they are largely unconscious, actually stopping squinting can require a lot to effort to realize what you are doing. Relaxing your neck and face muscles can help you to have better vision. Abdominal breathing can aid to improve your body posture and physiology so you are more relaxed. Sometimes it is just bad habits that we don\u0026rsquo;t see.\nDilts, R., Hallbom, T., \u0026amp; Smith, S. (2012). Beliefs: Pathways to health and well-being. Crown House Publishing.

Today blood testing allows us to know how to fast and the beneficial aspects of fasting. It is an ancient tradition in many cultures and has well-known benefits.\nModern man tends to dismiss the use of fasting preferring to use medication to alleviate the symptoms of a disease.\nAll animals fast when ill and we should do the same. Actually, fasting is easy physically but hard psychologically. I have fasted for 24, 48 and 72 hours several times, the 24 hour fast is the easiest and common fast and can be done by anyone.\nBe careful if you are diabetic or suffer from other conditions, is a good idea to ask a doctor if you can do this, unfortunately, few doctors know about fasting or have fasted themselves, how can you recommend or dismiss something you have not tried?\nWhy do you want to fast? cleansing, lose some pounds, more energy, improve a degenerative condition? Fasting can improve all of this but is not a panacea for every problem you might have.\nSince each person is different you need to inform yourself and try it, not everybody can fast, if you want to learn how to fast, you need to read about it or get the book I recommend.\nMy four day fast This is the log of my last four day fast:\nFasting Day 1\nDay 1 is easy, you just need to be busy with your work and not think about food at all. Avoid places where you usually eat food and take lots of water.\nYou will feel fine actually just be careful with habits like watching television and eating and you will be fine.\nFasting Day 2\nGet busy, ideas of eating will come and go so you need to stay focused on your goal. This day is much like day 1, urine shows no ketones in the morning.\nAvoid friends and people that will ruin your fast, if you are not busy your mind will crave food and fail.\nFasting Day 3\nEverything is OK, a few ketones in urine in the morning showing that your body is entering ketosis. Boredom is enemy number one, I start to feel a little weak.\nFasting Day 4\nA moderate amount of ketones in the urine (40mg/dl), I feel fine no headache whatsoever. I notice brighter colors in the supermarket and skin rash I had diminishes, weakness continues and after some trouble sleeping at night, I decided to break the fast the next morning.\nFasting Day 5\nI give up! large amounts of ketones in urine, I feel fine little weakness and mild headache.. nothing bad really, I could continue but I have decided to break the fast today.\nI decided to fast after reading a book by Dr. Joel Fuhrman, you can search for fasting on the net or google Herbert Shelton.\nBreaking a fast I always thought that when people told you to break the fast slowly with fruits and juices over several days they were exaggerating, until in this four-day fast I got a mild arrhythmia after Russian salad and blinis, bad idea.\nIt was not much food but caused me trouble, I didn\u0026rsquo;t end up in the ER but it was uncomfortable.\nNow I know that the end of a fast is very important, the body has mechanisms to compensate for things like a fast, so you have to be informed and take precautions and be ready.\nNext time I will try a five-day fast, my goal is a seven-day fast; the purpose of this is to get rid of the hypertension medication that I sometimes have to take after a hypertension attack five years ago.\nMust people don\u0026rsquo;t know that they can improve their health and get rid of unnecessary medication with a long enough fast.\nConclusion Fasting is safe and can help you to deal with many problems in a natural way, the hard part is that you need to believe it will work because requires strength of will.\nDo you want to give this old practice a try?

If you have a globus cone that will require a certain type of lens, different from the lens you need if you have a nipple cone. See the post on \u0026ldquo;keratoconus type of cones\u0026rdquo; on my blog.\nIn resume to have a good fit your doctor has to know the shape of your keratoconus corneas (nipple, oval, or globus), then choose the material of the lens (RPG, GP, or other), and finally the design and parameters of the lens.\nOther costs Another consideration is the cost, specialty contact lenses are expensive and sometimes insurance won\u0026rsquo;t cover for it, that and the fact that good fitters are not everywhere.\nSometimes you will need to travel long distances to get a good pair of contacts, even if this includes traveling abroad to your own city or country.\nIf you think about it, is like going to a very good tailor to make you a brand new fitted suit.\nGood Luck\nHeriberto R.\nHi, I love to improve myself and others.

To be honest: \u0026ldquo;I have not used these services and have no connection to the companies that I will mention\u0026rdquo;.\nInform yourself, you may find this unnecessary. But if I was 20 years old and recently diagnosed with keratoconus, with what I now know, I would be very interested in getting this information. Information is power when you use it as leverage to implement change.\nInflammation The problem we are dealing with is chronic low-grade inflammation, this is a subtle condition caused mainly by the food we eat.\nIn the case of keratoconus, the allergies that we suffer are probably related to this immune response.\nThe body is very good at adapting to substances that harm us, like cigars and booze, and when you withdraw the substance actually the body ask for more of it.\nTest for allergies/gluten sensitivity The number of people that are allergic to gluten is very low around one percent, but it is estimated that near 40 percent of us have a more than normal response to wheat gluten called gluten sensitivity. This means you will probably feel nothing after that delicious lasagna, but your gut will do something to protect itself. This response to a substance that we eat produces inflammation, the enemy number one we are trying to avoid, by having a \u0026ldquo;Food antibody test\u0026rdquo; we could know what foods we have problems with, and by avoiding those substances we reduce the inflammation of the body.\nTest for allergies/food The problem is that you will not notice anything wrong, this low-grade inflammation harms us slowly. An IgG Food Antibody test can give you the level of sensitivity to 87 common foods, this test is offered by \u0026lsquo;Genova Diagnostics Laboratory\u0026rsquo; and is done with a simple blood test. This is expensive and you will probably need a doctor to prescribe this analysis, but as said before this could save you a big headache years later.\nRead my post called vitamin \u0026amp; mineral supplements\nConclusion Usually, this was done by trial and error, you remove foods from your diet (the usual suspects), see how you feel, and then slowly reintroduce some of the foods one by one until you find the offending substance.\nWhat do you think?

The grounding techniques discussed here put your body closer to nature; this is the way it is supposed to be. Before the invention of clothing, the indigenous people like to run without shoes and had no problem with this. We are part of nature so by distancing from it we are affecting our body\u0026rsquo;s normal responses.\nBy grounding techniques I mean: being in contact with the earth. Do you know how an appliance needs to be grounded to function properly? You need the same care. Sounds ridiculous but your toaster is better grounded than yourself, certainly, we don\u0026rsquo;t realize how many electromagnetic fields we are in contact with; WiFi, cell phones, laptops, microwaves, appliances. Every electric power line produces a magnetic field.\nThese magnetic fields can affect your health, this is a recent phenomenon, today you see people with a cell phone all day close to their body even children. Traditional Chinese doctors recommend people to not wear quartz watches because the watch interferes with the normal electromagnetic field or the human body. You can get grounding products online, but i like to build things myself so I can save money.\nGrounding techniques/grounding your bed You can ground your bed with a piece of \u0026ldquo;metal\u0026rdquo; window screen, duct tape, a fuse, some wire, and a metal hanger that acts as a stake on the ground. The fuse is just a precaution measure, anyway, if there is a lightning storm near your home, just disconnect the fuse, the probability of a ray hitting your ground stake is very low, you may win the lottery instead.\nThe disadvantage of this is that I move a lot at night, so I tend to move the window screen and this displaces the duct tape, and spikes of window screen appear on the edges that pinch like needles and bother me. The solution was to add a silicon frame to the metal window screen and add extra duct tape.\nHands-on Disarm the metal hanger and cut a 16-inch piece with tweezers. Get some sandpaper and take off the finished painting from the metal hanger on both ends, so it becomes more conductive then dig it to your garden soil, the deeper the better; with an electric wire connect the hanger to the fuse compartment, insert a fuse and then solder/connect the fuse out to the window screen on your bed. Put your bed sheets as always (cotton preferably), and try to sleep without a shirt to have more contact with the screen.\nI do not recommend grounding your bed to the ground in your electrical outlet unless you live on a high building and have no other choice, and you have checked with an electrician if the ground is properly wired, sometimes is not\u0026hellip;especially in old buildings and houses. You might need a digital true RMS multimeter to test if it is working and to see the voltage that your body is conducting. Set the multi-meter to read ±.001 volts.\nGrounding options If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to ground your bed One option is to use an electromagnetic wristband, the one used by an electronic repairman to eliminate charges that damage sensitive electronic components; but I tend to move a lot my arms while sleeping and it is not that comfortable.\nAnother option is to use a disposable ECG patch on any part of your body that connects to the fuse of your grounding installation, I put the patch on my leg and it works. The only drawback is to get the cable that connects the patch to the ground, I used an alligator clamp in the beginning. You can order patches and cables over the internet (search \u0026ldquo;Earthing patches\u0026rdquo;), or search some medical supply companies that make those cables. I am a little handyman so I like to save money by doing things myself, in case earthing don\u0026rsquo;t work for me or I didn\u0026rsquo;t like it, I have not spent a fortune on gear I don\u0026rsquo;t use.\nThe most comfortable way is definitely the bed window metal screen. and it works even with a cotton blanket on top, I just remove my shirt to have more contact with the ground. How do I know? because I used the multimeter to measure the current that passes through my body.\nAlso, read my post on hyperbaric oxygen therapy.\nConclusion The easiest \u0026ldquo;ground technique\u0026rdquo; is for yourself to return to nature, walk without shoes in the sand or in your own backyard. It\u0026rsquo;s free; you can go to a near park and try to be more in contact with nature, the fear we have of nature is unfounded, nature has all we need to thrive.\nLeave a comment, or subscribe for more health advice.\nGood Luck!\nHi, I love to improve myself and others.

Should you trust that the companies that sell these products are honest and sincere? Or are they just trying to make a sell? I love to buy things that I believe are good for my health or that I need, however, most of the time you don\u0026rsquo;t need any of this.\nYou like to think that you are doing something good for your body and that is OK. In reality, your intention is very important, are you trying to improve a particular problem you have?\nCost of Vitamins and mineral supplements I found it very hard to justify the expense of some of these supplements, but I think there are incredible products out there that can help me. I always try to invest in myself so I might try some ideas to see if I like them and they work for me. The most important aspect of taking any pill or supplement is understanding what you are trying to achieve with it, are you sure you have a vitamin deficiency? How about a lack of a mineral in your body?\nI am not a big fan of supplements because most of us don\u0026rsquo;t know what we need in the first place, and the idea of consuming pills indiscriminately with the hope that they will solve our problems is not right. Most people will recommend some multivitamins to your daily regimen to avoid any lack of nutrients in your diet. Actually, the idea that you will get a deficiency is not far-fetched if you are a regular consumer of the standard American diet (SAD), but you must know that your body probably is working as it should, and has no problem with nutritional deficiencies.\nThe Truth As mentioned in the guide the most important aspect of your nutrition is the food that you consume, what you let into your body. It is sad but no pill or vitamin will ever help you if you don\u0026rsquo;t eat properly nutritious food. So instead of trying to buy the next amazing product, why don\u0026rsquo;t you try to bring some amazing food to your body? There is much nutritional information and you will find many ideas from Ayurveda to traditional Chinese medicine.\nIn the end, how you feel after eating is an important indicator, and your body will tell you by the reaction to the food you consume if it is good for you or not. If you feel sluggish and tired and every once in a while you blurt after a meal, and you are constipated it is obvious that your alimentary habits can be improved.\nFirst, invest in your food, and later you can try to supplement.\nExercise is very important since can help you improve your metabolism and keep a slim figure. No pill will ever be a substitute for eating a good amount of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and drinking plain water and go out to get some sun on your skin\nConclusion If you don\u0026rsquo;t or can\u0026rsquo;t improve what you eat it is good to supplement, but you will be losing the low-hanging fruit and spend too much money for too few results.\nWhat do you think? subscribe, or leave a comment below.\nGood Luck!\nHi, I love to improve myself and others.

The origin of Chinese Herbal Formulas is found in the high mountains of China where every plant, animal, and mineral was tested as medicine in the search for the fountain of youth.\nWhile they didn\u0026rsquo;t find that, they discovered that herbs possessed properties that were useful in the treatment of many afflictions and diseases. These Chinese herbal formulas are selected by a concept called the principle of Ying/Yang, and by the body of knowledge called the five energies.\nThe five energies concept The five energies are Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, and Wood. Each energy is related to a Yin and a Yang organ and paired to a specific emotion, color, taste, season, climate, and body function. For instance, the liver is a Yin organ with Wood energy, sour flavor, related to the nervous system, color green, opens the eyes, emotion/anger, season/spring, climate/windy, and its related Yang organ is the gallbladder.\nTraditional Chinese Medicine also takes into count the mental state and emotions (anger, fear, stress) and the external factors like the weather (winds, heat, humidity), to make a more broad diagnosis of the treatment required by the patient.\nDifferential diagnosis \u0026amp; The eight indicators The patient\u0026rsquo;s symptoms are then analyzed with a list called the eight indicators, to form a differential diagnosis of the stage of the disease. And later apply corrective measures to bring balance and cure the patient. Herbal compounds have an affinity for specific organs that need balance. In Chinese medicine, the disease is believed to be an imbalance in the human energy system, and this system is a mirror/reflection of the universe around us.\nChinese Herbal Formulas \u0026ldquo;Patents\u0026rdquo; The other option is to buy \u0026ldquo;patent formulas\u0026rdquo; for the condition that you suffer, there are hundreds of patent herbal formulas and they can be bought in any Chinatown around the globe or online. You usually take 8 pills (wan) three times a day with warm water on an empty stomach for as long as you need it, a bottle will last just eight days, so you will need three bottles for a basic treatment.\nThe only caveat is that they are less powerful than the pharmacy-prepared herbs. Chinese herbs are a safe way of stimulating your own body\u0026rsquo;s healing mechanisms. They are safer than any drug or treatment you can buy in the west that usually masks symptoms without attending to their causes.\nChinese Pharmacy Usually, when you have a \u0026ldquo;small problem\u0026rdquo; with your health you visit a Chinese Doctor or herbalist and he prescribes a herbal treatment to aid you, whatever this might be. Pain, inflammation, cold, etc\u0026hellip;\nThe herbalist will mix the different herbs in the formula and give to you instructions on how to prepare and consume the formula which is usually a herbal tea.\nRead more about in the post: traditional Chinese medicine.\nChinese herbal medicine is fun and lets you be your doctor in your own kitchen. The next time you visit Chinatown venture into this world, it is amazing!\nAre you interested in this ancient healing technique? let me know what you think.\nleave a comment below, like, or subscribe to my newsletter.\nGood luck!\nHi, I love to improve myself and others.

The term topography is related to the study of the earth\u0026rsquo;s surface but is wrongly used in ophthalmology imaging. Who has not seen these corneal tomography images that your doctor used to diagnose your keratoconus? I have always wanted to understand more about these maps of the cornea but was clueless about their meaning.\nBrands of imaging systems There are many different brands of imaging systems: the Orbscan (Bausch \u0026amp; Lomb, Rochester, NY), the Pentacam (Oculus, Inc., Lynnwood, Washington), and the Galilei Dual Scheimpflug Analyzer (Ziemer Ophthalmic Systems AG, Port, Switzerland), but I will explain the data generated by one of the most common ones the Orbscan.\nThe Orbscan The Orbscan© shows the front and back shape of the cornea and its thickness. This corneal tomography uses a \u0026ldquo;best-fit sphere\u0026rdquo; method to calculate the highs and lows of the surface.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like the sea level that establishes the high of every mountain, city or lake in the world, for instance, New Orleans is 6 feet below sea level and Mexico City is 2200 meters above it.\nTomography colors These highs and lows are represented with a scale of colors ranging from light green (sea level) to dark red (very high), and below the green from light blues to dark purples for the negative values (below sea level).\nThe colors in the map represent these altitudes and a difference of usually 10 or 20 microns means the color scale changes. Light colors like green mean near-normal surfaces, yellow and orange colors mean higher areas.\nA micron is a size of a millimeter divided by a thousand, just to compare a bacteria can measure 5 microns.\nOrbscan views The Orb scan has four views from the top left and clockwise, (Anterior, Posterior, Thickness, and Keratometric).\nThe most useful views for diagnosing are the Posterior, Anterior, and Pachymetry thickness maps, the Posterior float is regarded as the most useful to diagnose developing keratoconus commonly called form fruste keratoconus.\nOn the image below I have marked some values that you need to compare with normal corneal values to diagnose probable keratoconus. on the top center of the image the two D values from the anterior and posterior maps can be compared with:\na) Posterior Best fit Sphere less than 52D is normal, more than this abnormal, in this case, 53.8.\nb) Sim K\u0026rsquo;s max keratometry of more than 45.7D is suspect, in this case, 54.9\nc) On the Pachymetry map on the right and below if we find the thinnest area less than 470 microns it is suspect of thinning due to keratoconus, you can see the lowest value is 447 microns on the center thick value, this is near the apex of the cone.\nd) The difference between the central thickness value in this image 468 microns and the thinnest area in this case 447 has to be between 15 and 20 microns, 21 is above and not normal.\nIndices Irregularity at 3mm zone more than 1.5D can suggest Keratoconus. Irregularity at 5mm zone more than 2D to 3D can suggest the same.\nGenerally speaking, when you see Anterior and Posterior maps with more than three colors this is suspected to be abnormal, in this case blue, orange, yellow, and red.\nCorneal Thickness Elevation maps are more accurate in showing the morphology of the cone and in this case, the elevated areas coincide with the thinnest corneal thickness on the Pachymetry map showing clearly the island formed by the cone protrusion.\nThe thickness is important since the thickness of the cornea is a value used for qualifying you to treatments like Intacs or crosslinking, usually a minimum of 400 microns thickness.\nBiography: Belin, Michael W., MD, FACS; Khachikian, Stephen S., MD; Ambrosio Jr., Renato, MD, PhD\n“ELEVATION BASED CORNEAL TOMOGRAPHY\u0026quot; © Copyright, 2012 for Jaypee - Highlights Medical Publishers, Inc. Conclusion Are you more confused? I hope this helps a bit to understand more about the type of keratoconus you have and its severity.

Dr. Richard Neubauer one of the pioneers of the technique used to say that the future of neurology is going to be linked to Hyperbaric Medicine.\nUsually, the hyperbaric chamber is an acrylic individual bed but there are chambers for 2-5 people at the same time.\nPreparation for HBOT The first time you will consult with a doctor that has experience with the process. You will be asked about your prior medical history and probably will do some blood work.\nAfter that initial consultation, you have to tell them what do you expect from the treatment or treatments. Be aware of possible problems like any broken dental filling or sinus congestion that you have, since pressure can exacerbate the issue.\nExperience of hyperbaric oxygen therapy The experience is not for the nervous or claustrophobic. You will feel a little bit clumsy in the beginning, I was wearing an oxygen mask all the time approximately one hour.\nThe idea of being trapped for an hour can be hard for some people and sounds illogical until you try it, the experience is similar to flying on a plane to some near city.\nWhat really helped me was to concentrate on my breathing and forget I was trapped in this chamber.\nAfter a few minutes, I started to, recite the yoga\u0026rsquo;s mantra _sat-_nam, sat on inhalation and nam on exhalation and I applied the famous Navy Seal breathing technique of inhaling deeply for a count of six, hold it for a count of two and then exhale for a count of six completely emptying your lungs.\nI did this three times and then breathe normally for a minute and then do it all again.\nThe cost of HBOT is not cheap in the U.S. around $150 since very few conditions are covered by medical insurance.\nMy idea was to make some mental gymnastics while in the chamber, what I noticed was that I remembered things that I had forgotten long ago, as some friend from childhood, and some events in the past that I had no recollection of whatsoever.\nSome people use this technology for prevention purposes, for instance, if you have family members with degenerative conditions you can try this on yourself a couple of times a year or if you have a corneal transplant rejection you could try this to help to avoid the rejection.\nHi, I love to improve myself and others.\nReach me on social media or at heribertorangel.com\nGood Luck!\nHeriberto R.\nJoin #HealthyEyes news\u0026hellip; and Get info fast ","permalink":"https://keratoconusguide.netlify.app/blog/hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy/","tags":["post","blog","old"],"title":"Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy"},{"categories":["India"],"contents":"Keratoconus treatment in Ayurveda The long history of Ayurveda remedies spanning thousands of years is basically and more elegantly explained as \u0026ldquo;getting along with nature and its rhythms\u0026rdquo;. On the other hand, we have realized that fighting with nature has caused great suffering in the world, nature is wise and always helps to achieve balance if you let her.\nAyurvedic treatment for keratoconus Keratoconus treatment in Ayurveda would be indirect: Improving digestion (increase agni) and cleansing your body of metabolic debris that impair immunity and cause the reduction of enzymatic protection reaching your eyes. By improving oxygenation, and reducing mechanical stress to the cornea, the eyes will avoid further deterioration.\nAyurveda remedies These Ayurveda remedies are highly recommended, I have used the powdered herb form for many years and I haven\u0026rsquo;t had any problems.\nThese Indian herbs are Tumeric, Triphala, and Ashwagandha are shown below.\nTurmeric The famous bulb is used extensively in Indian cuisine and adds the characteristic yellow color to curry dishes. Moreover, Tumeric has been recently regarded as a potent antioxidant and activator of the body\u0026rsquo;s enzymatic defenses.\nThis is how your body defends itself against free radical damage, and is backed by many scientific studies.\nYou can cook many dishes with it; from rice to curry or take it as an infusion. You can even put a little bit on a warm cup of milk or tea. A good example is the ayurvedic plate khichdi (kitchary) made with basmati rice, mung beans and turmeric, ginger, cumin, fennel, and other spices.\nTriphala One of the most important Ayurveda remedies and actually the powder made with the fruits of three myrobalan trees called Amalaki, Bibhitaki, and Haritaki. Is regarded as a powerful stimulant of digestion with antioxidant and noninflammatory properties.\nIn India is common to say that if you don\u0026rsquo;t have medicine but Triphala you are fine.\nYou can make Triphala tea on a coffee maker, put it on milk or tea or mix it with honey and eat it, you can also make Triphala eye drops with purified water, little sea salt, and of course strain the liquid very well. Triphala is very special, the first time you smell and taste it you will know you are in front of something very good for your health.\nAshwagandha The root of this plant is regarded as having similar properties as the Chinese ginseng, stimulating the famous Nrf2 antioxidant pathway on the cells to produce protective enzymes. Ashwagandha powder is whiter than Triphala and tends to be denser so it is better to eat it than to strain it.\nMany people use it for its anxiety-reducing effects and for centuries has been used to have a good night of sleep. Just put a teaspoon in a warm glass of milk and drink it before going to bed. As always be careful with what you put in your body, consult your doctor or Ayurveda practitioner, and if you have a problem stop using it.\nRead my post on How to fast.\nConclusion In short, these three remedies are highly recommended for thousands of people, and studies show that are safe and help your body in many ways.\nYou can find reliable distributors of these herbs on the internet, I have used the powder herb (curna), form for many years and I haven\u0026rsquo;t had any problems at all.\nWould you like to give a try to these ancient remedies?

The first time you realize you have visual problems is at school, you just can\u0026rsquo;t see clearly from behind the classroom, so you have to sit closer to the blackboard. When you went to the movies, you could not read the subtitles.\nSoon you will learn to squint to try to see, this is classic child behavior, as an adolescent, you will wear glasses and need new prescriptions regularly, the sad part is that you will likely pass un-diagnosed for a long time since early keratoconus only produces a refractive error (meaning astigmatism and myopia), that can be corrected with glasses. It is years later that when your condition worsens, you are diagnosed because normal glasses or contact lenses can not help you anymore.\nThis happens when you go to a more experienced optometrist or contact lens fitter and he performs a series of tests like corneal pachymetry (testing the thickness of your cornea) or if he suspects you have keratoconus he performs an corneal topography, it is then that he will tell you you have keratoconus, of course very experienced OD by just examining your eyes with a lamp can see signs of the condition, but in early stages can be very difficult to diagnose.\nBeto R.\nHi, I love to improve myself and others.

So we need to start with an open mind and learn about causes.\nAllergies Allergies are immune responses to external factors like dust, pollen, mold, or cat hair. Certainly, It is well documented that keratoconus patients suffer more ocular allergies than the rest of the population and that the common response is rubbing the eyeball. This is how we damage our cornea when we are young and nobody tells us we are doing something harmful.\nInflammation Even though keratoconus is considered to be a non-inflammatory degenerative disease, this is probably not the case. When inflammation slowly persists for many years by other reasons like diet, genetic, or environmental causes, this can damage the body over time.\nKeratoconus Hypothesis The cascade Hypothesis The cascade hypothesis ⁠1 is one of the most accepted theories about the origin and causes of keratoconus, this keratoconus hypothesis concludes that the cornea of someone with keratoconus is exposed to factors that produce free radicals.\nThis creates a cascade of events that result in corneal scarring and apoptosis. This is a process in which the body instructs the cell to die so that it doesn’t interfere with other processes and functions of the whole body, (cell programmed death).\nThe cornea of someone with keratoconus is not normally protected against free radicals, so it is slowly damaged in the long run. The majority of adult people with keratoconus can be stable for many years and only 1 in 10 will require surgery. Your goal must be to be in that 90% who can function without surgeries. In short this means that your keratoconus advances slowly every day if you have low enzymatic protection aggravated by other causes. These causes can be lifestyle, nutrition, and environment (contact lens) related.\nEye Rubbing Hypothesis Keratoconus corneas are exposed to elevated enzymes that degrade proteins. These enzymes are called proteases and they increase their activity4 probably after vigorous eye rubbing⁠5\nThere is also a strong relationship between the keratoconus severity and the way the person rubs his eyes. His dominant hand (right or left) \u0026ldquo;usually\u0026rdquo; means his worst condition eye, mine is. Even the position you take when sleeping can impact your vision.\nAll this suggests a big relationship between mechanical trauma to the cornea and the advancement of keratoconus. Meaning that if you have keratoconus probably your corneas are thinner than regular corneas but the main cause of your keratoconus worsening is unconscious eye rubbing (eye strain) during long periods of time.\nIt is hard to quantify eye rubbing, especially in young persons because it is a bad unconscious habit. It is paramount that you bring consciousness to how you treat your eyes so that if you are rubbing them, you stop immediately doing it.\nEye rubbing can be related to allergies, dry eye, or other conditions hard to determine.\nIn a French study called “the keratoconus and eye rubbing prospective online study”, evidence was found suggesting that stopping rubbing your eyes can even stop the progression of the keratoconus.\nThey concluded “There is a striking correlation between the more advanced side of keratoconus and the side that is rubbed more, as well as the sleeping position”\nThat is why I believe getting contacts and cross-linking is not enough. You need to realize how you use your eyes so you can stop bad habits like rubbing and squinting and take care of allergies and posture when you sleep.\nOxidative Stress Hypothesis Oxidative stress is the imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in favor of the oxidants⁠2. One of the areas of research into the probable cause of keratoconus is the role of oxidative stress⁠3\nThere needs to exist a balance between degradative enzymes, and the inhibitor enzymes (those that reduce their actions) and the level of environmental stress that the cornea suffers, this is called homeostasis.\nIf we have an eye degenerative condition this is due to multiple factors, therefore it is hard to isolate one cause and find one solution.\nWant to know more? read the post: keratoconus overview.\nGood Luck!\nHeriberto R.\n[1] Cristina Kenney M, Brown, Donald J “The cascade hypothesis of keratoconus,” Contact lens \u0026amp; anterior eye: the journal of the British Contact Lens Association 2003 Sep;26(3):139-46.\n[2] Sies H, Jones DP.

Your main objective must be to have an adequate vision for your life needs (study, job, fun).\n1.- Calm down and get informed. Don\u0026rsquo;t rush things by trying to get rid of the problem immediately.\n2.- The first line of treatment is \u0026ldquo;specialty contact lenses\u0026rdquo;. Find a good lens fitter with experience adapting lenses to keratoconus patients.\nHe or she is usually an O.D. in a big metropolitan area like Chicago or New York, or try a University Ophthalmology Department like UCLA.\nIn other parts of the world, you can find them on the websites of the companies that made the specialty contact lenses.\nWhere to inform yourself 3.- Visit sites like the National Keratoconus Foundation, they have lots of information, a forum for KC\u0026rsquo;ers, and by request a list of doctors anywhere in the world.\n4.- If you are just diagnosed it is rare that your case is very advanced, I believe you have time to get informed.\nTry contact lenses and adapt to your condition, of course, listen to your doctor, I ideally would recommend visiting two doctors.\nA new life-style 5.- Relax. Your eyes are probably very tired and hurt for years of use and abuse, take a rest and let them heal a little.\nRemove your contacts when you want to rest of them and learn to relax your neck and shoulders, try to rest every 30 minutes on the computer.\n6.- Breathe: Related to relaxing is breathing, inhale and raise your belly, try to smile, and yawn every time you can.\nCheck your posture and the height of your chair and your monitor screen, some minor adjustments can improve relaxation and reduce visual stress.\n7.- Take long walks and look in the distance, looking afar is relaxing, all day looking close to objects or a monitor is harmful to your eyes.\nThis is just the beginning you can do much more, get my health guide for people with keratoconus on my website:\nwww.keratoconusguide.com\nGood luck.\nHeriberto R.\nJoin #HealthyEyes news\u0026hellip; and Get info fast ","permalink":"https://keratoconusguide.netlify.app/posts/top-7-things-to-do-if-you-have-keratoconus/","tags":["Post","Blog","contact lenses"],"title":"Top 7 things to do if you have Keratoconus"}]
