Vitamin and mineral supplements
-------------------------------

This is a theme that is certainly obscure, should you take vitamin and mineral supplements just to avoid a problem later? Should you trust that the companies that sell these products are honest and sincere? Or are they just trying to make a sell? Â  _I love to buy things that I believe are good for my health or that I need_, however, most of the time you don't need any of this.

You like to think that you are doing something good for your body and that is OK. In reality, your intention is very important, are you trying to improve a particular problem you have?

### **Cost of Vitamins and mineral supplements**

I found it very hard to justify the expense of some of these supplements, but I think there are incredible products out there that can help me. I always try to invest in myself so I might try some ideas to see if I like them and they work for me. The most important aspect of taking any pill or supplement is understanding what you are trying to achieve with it, are you sure you have a vitamin deficiency? How about a lack of a mineral in your body?

I am not a big fan of supplements because most of us don't know what we need in the first place, and the idea of consuming pills indiscriminately with the hope that they will solve our problems is not right. Most people will recommend some multivitamins to your daily regimen to avoid any lack of nutrients in your diet. Actually, the idea that you will get a deficiency is not far-fetched if you are a regular consumer of the standard American diet (SAD), but you must know that your body probably is working as it should, and has no problem with nutritional deficiencies.

### **The Truth**

As mentioned in the guide the most important aspect of your nutrition is the food that you consume, what you let into your body. It is sad but no pill or vitamin will ever help you if you don't eat properly nutritious food. So instead of trying to buy the next amazing product, why don't you try to bring some amazing food to your body? There is much nutritional information and you will find many ideas from Ayurveda to traditional Chinese medicine.

In the end, how you feel after eating is an important indicator, and your body will tell you by the reaction to the food you consume if it is good for you or not. If you feel sluggish and tired and every once in a while you blurt after a meal, and you are constipated it is obvious that your alimentary habits can be improved.

First, invest in your food, and later you can try to supplement.

Exercise is very important since can help you improve your metabolism and keep a slim figure. **No pill will ever be a substitute for eating a good amount of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and drinking plain water and go out to get some sun on your skin**

### Conclusion

>If you don't or can't improve what you eat it is good to supplement, but you will be losing the low-hanging fruit and spend too much money for too few results.
