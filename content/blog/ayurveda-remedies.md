Keratoconus treatment in Ayurveda
---------------------------------

The long history of Ayurveda remedies spanning thousands of years is basically and more elegantly explained as "_getting along with nature and its rhythms_". On the other hand, we have realized that fighting with nature has caused great suffering in the world, nature is wise and always helps to achieve balance if you let her.

### Ayurvedic treatment for keratoconus

Keratoconus treatment in Ayurveda would be indirect: Improving digestion (_increase agni_) and cleansing your body of metabolic debris that impair immunity and cause the reduction of enzymatic protection reaching your eyes. By improving oxygenation, and reducing mechanical stress to the cornea, the eyes will avoid further deterioration.

#### Turmeric

The famous bulb is used extensively in Indian cuisine and adds the characteristic yellow color to curry dishes. Moreover, _Tumeric_ has been recently regarded as a potent antioxidant and activator of the body's enzymatic defenses.

This is how your body defends itself against free radical damage, and is backed by many [_scientific studies_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26342520).

You can cook many dishes with it; from rice to curry or take it as an infusion. You can even put a little bit on a warm cup of milk or tea. A good example is the _ayurvedic_ plate [_khichdi_](https://ayurveda-foryou.com/treat/khichari.html) (kitchary) made with _basmati_ rice, mung beans and _turmeric_, ginger, cumin, fennel, and other spices.

#### Triphala

One of the most important Ayurveda remedies and actually the powder made with the fruits of three myrobalan trees called Amalaki, Bibhitaki, and Haritaki. Is regarded as a powerful stimulant of digestion with antioxidant and noninflammatory properties.

In India is common to say that if you don't have medicine but _Triphala_ you are fine.

You can make _Triphala_ tea on a coffee maker, put it on milk or tea or mix it with honey and eat it, you can also make _Triphala_ eye drops with purified water, little sea salt, and of course strain the liquid very well. _Triphala_ is very special, the first time you smell and taste it you will know you are in front of something very good for your health.

#### Ashwagandha

The root of this plant is regarded as having similar properties as the Chinese _ginseng_, stimulating the famous Nrf2 antioxidant pathway on the cells to produce protective enzymes. Ashwagandha powder is whiter than _Triphala_ and tends to be denser so it is better to eat it than to strain it.

Many people use it for its anxiety-reducing effects and for centuries has been used to have a good night of sleep. Just put a teaspoon in a warm glass of milk and drink it before going to bed. As always be careful with what you put in your body, consult your doctor or _Ayurveda_ practitioner, and if you have a problem stop using it.
