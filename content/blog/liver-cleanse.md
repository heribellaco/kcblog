Liver Cleanse
-------------

I have performed _liver cleanses_ (flushes) over the years and they have worked, i did it because of my bad habits regarding food. But the main reason was that I learned the connection of the liver in [**_Traditional Chinese Medicine_**](../traditional-chinese-medicine/) to the health of the eyes.

The cleansing of the liver is an old practice in [_Ayurveda_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda), basically, you purge yourself with oil so that the gallbladder expels the intra-hepatic gallstones to your intestines where they can be removed in your feces.

I have had better results in the first three or four cleanses, the procedure I used was the following\*

### How to cleanse your liver

1.- For seven days eat only healthy foods (no animal protein and nothing fried or oily).  
Drink one liter of apple juice on the last five of these seven days. Regular apple juice is fine.

2.- On the six-day ideally, on a Saturday: Drink the last liter of apple juice in the morning, eat a very light meal (fruit and rice for example), early like 1 pm and in the afternoon do the following:

* * *

Add 4 tablespoons of [Epsom salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_sulfate) (magnesium sulfate), to three 8 oz cups of water.  
Mix well, and you will get "four" 6 oz portions (3/4 cup).

Drink your first portion early afternoon between 6 and 7 pm.

Drink your second portion two hours later.

3.- Before bed at night (The Flush).

Squeeze some grapefruits to get 3/4 glass of juice and add 1/2 cup of olive oil.

Shake the juice/oil until blended in a jar.

Drink the oil mixture and go to bed immediately, around 10 pm. Close your nose while drinking this because the taste is horrendous.

The next day early drink your third 6oz portion of diluted Epsom salt.

Two hours later drink the last 6oz portion.

That's it, don't go out on Sunday and stay close to the bath. This is because Epsom salt

is a kind of [laxative](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/20-natural-laxatives).

If you want get an enema to help get out the stones. but I think most of them come out by themselves.

>If you are adventureous you can try this to see if it works. Dont be scared, purging yourself with oil is an old tradition lost in the modern world.
