Macronutrients
--------------

The basic nutrients definition is comprised of **_protein_**, **_carbohydrate_**, and **_fats_** (called macronutrients). They represent all that we eat. Most foods have nutrients in different proportions. For example, a banana has mostly carbohydrates and very little protein and fiber, a steak has mostly protein and fat.

It is not necessary to find out what foods have protein or fat, most fruits and vegetables have some protein and carbohydrates and also lots of micro-nutrients, I recommend a diet with lots of green vegetables like spinach and broccoli, some grains and seeds for the essential fatty acids and as little animal protein as possible. Food largely depends on your personal habits and preferences. Some people love refined carbohydrates like pasta and pizza. I think is better to reduce the number of foods that are highly processed or refined.

### Nutrients definition/Carbohydrates

White bread and pasta tend to have a high [_**glycemic load**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_load), they are absorbed very quickly by your body and cause spikes in your insulin production. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps to move the energy (glucose) to the cells of your body. Too much insulin or too little is very dangerous to your eyes. So it is better to consume whole grain pasta and bread instead of the plain white flour variety.

### Essential Fatty Acids

It is good that you consume essential omega 3 fatty acids in the form of ground flax-seed with your cereal or fruit and add some nuts and seeds to your diet, they can be added to your salad or shake in the morning. Another good source of polyunsaturated fatty acids are seeds like [_**chia**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chia_seed) or sunflower seeds, almonds, pecans, and almost all nuts. Try to get them raw, unsalted, and not roasted since this reduces their nutritional value.

You can soak the almonds in the water for a few hours to remove the skins before eating them, this makes them easier to digest.

### Micro-nutrients

Micro-nutrients are **_vitamins_** and **_minerals_**, they are required for different purposes and generally obtained from food. Since we are constantly exposed to all types of toxins, pesticides, chemical fertilizers, and food additives, it is a good idea to know a bit about the vitamins and minerals that can help to defend us against disease.

### Conclusion

>In short, you have a full arsenal of nutrients in all the vegetables and fruit that you consume and it is just a case of having a varied diet and not abusing any group too much.
