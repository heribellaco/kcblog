Testing for allergies
---------------------

This is interesting but controversial. If you suffer from a "**_chronic degenerative condition_**" like _keratoconus_ or any other, it is probably intelligent to test for allergies. To be honest: "_**I have not used these services and have no connection to the companies that I will mention**_".

Inform yourself, you may find this unnecessary. But if I was 20 years old and recently diagnosed with keratoconus, with what I now know, I would be very interested in getting this information. Information is power when you use it as leverage to implement change.

### Inflammation

The problem we are dealing with is _chronic low-grade inflammation_, this is a subtle condition caused mainly by the food we eat.  
In the case of keratoconus, the allergies that we suffer are probably related to this immune response.  
The body is very good at adapting to substances that harm us, like cigars and booze, and when you withdraw the substance actually the body ask for more of it.

### Test for allergies/gluten sensitivity

The number of people that are allergic to gluten is very low around one percent, but it is estimated that near 40 percent of us have a more than normal response to wheat gluten called _gluten sensitivity_. This means you will probably feel nothing after that delicious lasagna, but your gut will do something to protect itself. This response to a substance that we eat produces inflammation, the enemy number one we are trying to avoid, by having a "Food antibody test" we could know what foods we have problems with, and by avoiding those substances we reduce the inflammation of the body.

### Test for allergies/food

The problem is that you will not notice anything wrong, this low-grade inflammation harms us slowly. An IgG Food Antibody test can give you the level of sensitivity to 87 common foods, this test is offered by '[_**Genova Diagnostics Laboratory**_](https://www.gdx.net/)' and is done with a simple blood test. This is expensive and you will probably need a doctor to prescribe this analysis, but as said before this could save you a big headache years later.

Read my post called [**_vitamin & mineral supplements_**](../vitamin-and-mineral-supplements/)

### Conclusion

>Usually, this was done by trial and error, you remove foods from your diet (the usual suspects), see how you feel, and then slowly reintroduce some of the foods one by one until you find the offending substance.
