Healthy Smoothie Recipe
-----------------------

This healthy smoothie recipe is based on Rhonda Patrick Ph.D. smoothie and contains all the basic antioxidants and phytonutrients needed in your diet.

I love salads, unfortunately, salads are a little bit work-intensive. You need fresh ingredients and a self-made vinaigrette with a little oil.

So a **_healthy smoothie_** is a very easy option to get all that nutrients in liquid form and has all that fiber that is so good for your digestion. A smoothie is very fulfilling I can easily substitute one meal with a smoothie.

You can use your regular blender no need to buy an expensive one.  
First the ingredients: Spinach, Kale, Celery, Carrot, Avocado, Tomato, Banana, Apple, Blueberries, and Flax-seed or sunflower seeds.

Depending on where you get your produce just wash it and disinfect it. Especially spinach, celery, and kale.

Put everything in the blender.

Add 2-3 cups of water or one cup of almond or rice milk and two of water.  
Blend.

If it is too dense for you just add more water.

It certainly looks bad, but I assure you the taste is actually great.

If you have a sweet tooth you can add little molasses, _[stevia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevia)_, honey or more bananas or even strawberries to taste.

**Enjoy**.

>PS. Finally, depending on your blender vase size, experiment with the portions of vegetables, the green ones take less space and the blueberries are so small that disappear in the mix.
