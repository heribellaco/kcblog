Affirmations for Health
-----------------------

### How you lie to yourself

Man is a lying organism, in fact, the evolution of the unconscious appears to be related to how a man lies to himself to get benefits for this deceiving. When we are making "**_affirmations for health_**" we are doing what everyone does but we are doing it consciously and with a goal in mind. We all lie to ourself's and others, we exaggerate our capacity and diminish the capacity of our competition at the same time. We do this because it is important to our survival.

### The Unconscious

In its book, [_Psychocybernetics_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SI02BW4/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0) Maxwell Maltz tells us that the unconscious has a goal-seeking mechanism and that it must be fed a goal through imagination to try to strive for it.

That is exactly what we do when we make affirmations, we relax and repeat in a loud voice or internally or listen or in writing what we want to achieve.

Affirmations must be personal, this means that you can repeat somebody else affirmations, but to be more effective you have to adapt them to your situation and goals. Affirmations must be repeated with faith.

In the book "_Think and grow rich_" Napoleon hill recommends repeating what you desire with emotion, this is one the most important ingredients of achieving your goals.

### How to make your own affirmations

*   _First, they need to be repeated in the present tense as if they were real and you had them already._
*   _Second, they need to be expressed as positives, the unconscious mind doesn't" process negatives._
*   _Affirmations need to be personal "I", important to you, specific and clear._
*   _Finally, you have to relax your body and breath, with no distractions and repeat them with faith as if they were true._

* * *

If you think about it, this is essentially what people call "_praying_" in many religions. You are stating what you want, relaxing closing your eyes, and mixing it with faith that God will help you achieve your desire. It is actually uncanny how this works sometimes.

"I eat healthy food", "I am calm and relaxed", "I walk every day" these examples work. " I don't smoke anymore" is an affirmation that is not correct, or "I am going to lose weight" is stated in the future, " I will change the world" is not very specific and in the future tense.

If you want to have more impact you can repeat the affirmation to yourself, then in the second person and then in the third person. Like this "_I am extraordinary_", "_you are extraordinary"_, "_beto is extraordinary_".

>So think about what you want to see in your world and write some affirmations, make reading them a habit, just for five minutes in the morning or when you can do them.
