Test for Nutrient Deficiencies
------------------------------

How do you know if you have a nutrient deficiency? What was first the egg or the chicken? If you don’t know how can you have a well-targeted supplementation plan? Taking pills blindly is like shooting in the dark.

if you are healthy and have a nutritious diet, exercise any other day, and have good energy, you are ok. But if you have a degenerative condition it is a good idea to have a nutrition profile.

As you now know the enzyme protection of the body depends on many nutrients obtained from food and since you have a problem, a nutrition assessment could help you with supplementation.

### Supplementation

Supplementing is not as easy as taking a bunch of pills, some supplements can affect the absorption of others, but a nutritionist can help you to have a more targeted supplementation plan.

To be honest, not many doctors know about nutrition, they specialize in diagnostic and treatment, we want to prevent our condition to get worse in the future.

### Nutrient deficiency Test

The ‘Genova Diagnostics laboratory’ mentioned before offers a nutritional deficiency panel “NutrEval”, which looks very good, just enter their website. Also, check ‘Spectracell laboratory’ in Houston, they specialize in nutritional deficiency testing, the same expensive tag applies around $400.

If you have the resources it might worth the shoot, but don’t expect to change your life forever, this is information that can help to improve your health in the years to come.

>In the end, the best investment you can make is to get rid of: Refined sugar, bleached flour products, sodas, canned goods, gluten-containing foods, alcoholic beverages, MSG, table salt, hydrogenated vegetable oils, margarine, tobacco, processed dairy products, highly processed meat, pork, chicken, fish, fast foods, fried foods, smoked meats, and sausages.

A sad boring life really.

Good luck.
