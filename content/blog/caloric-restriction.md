Caloric restriction
-------------------

Caloric restriction has been proved in laboratory studies as the only way of extending the lifespan of rats\[1\], in other words, those that eat all they want to die faster than those who have a restrictive diet. This means that eating too much food is bad for you, of course, we are not rats; but remember that digestion requires that you spend energy (enzymes) processing the food you eat.

### What to do

You can reduce the calories you consume or you can [fast](../how-to-fast/) certainly calorie reduction can help to reduce the oxidative damage from free radicals and improve the enzymatic protection your cells have.

 However, do you know your caloric requirements? First, It is easy to calculate your caloric requirements, you just need to know five things, your age (years), sex (male, female), height (centimeters), weight (kilograms), and your approximate activity level.

### Caloric restriction formulas

The next formula is called the Harris-Benedict formula for the scientists that created it. In conclusion, by calculating your basal metabolic rest rate you will know how much energy your body requires daily. Multiply this for your activity level and finally, you will know how many calories your body needs to maintain your weight.

#### **Harris-Benedict formulas**

BMR=basal metabolic rate

**For Men**  
BMR=66.4730+(13.7516\*weight)+(5.0033\*height)-(6.7550\*age)

**For Woman**  
BMR=655.0955+(9.5634\*weight)+(1.8496\*height)-(4.6756\*age)

Now multiply this **BMR** for the activity chart level number below according to with your exercise level to get your daily metabolic expenditure in kilocalories.

|       Exercise                   |      Daily Caloric Expenditure  | 
| -------------------------------  | ----------------------------- |
| _Little or no exercise_          |  DCE=BMRx1.2    |
| _Light exercise_ (1 days a week) |  DCE=BMRx1.375  |
|_Moderate exercise_ (3 days a week) |  DCE=BMRx1.55 | 
|_Strong exercise_ (6-7 days a week) |  DCE=BMRx1.725|  
|_Very strong exercise_            |:    DCE=BMRx1.9   |

Most importantly, men need more calories than a woman, even a reduction of 500 calories is enough to have a calorie reduction that can benefit your health.

### Conclusion

>The number you get is the number of calories that your body spends every 24 hours according to your level of activity. This formula can give you a rough estimate of how many calories you need to reduce from your diet to start losing some weight.
