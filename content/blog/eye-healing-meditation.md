You can think of health as a state of "**harmony"** between the different parts of yourself. Most alternative treatments like an _eye healing meditation_ are based on the concept that your body can regain balance and vitality itself. This is done by removing the stress that caused the problem in the first place, and then creating the conditions for your body to heal and restore.

### What is this guided eye healing meditation?

This guided eye healing meditation is based in a Nero-Linguistic Programming (**NLP**) strategy discovered by studying the creative thinking process of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and applied it to help cure disease. This strategy is taken from Robert Dilts excellent book \**Beliefs\**.

This is a guided meditation which means you are going to listen to my voice, relax and imagine a color you like, a smell you adore, and also a sound that attracts you.

### How to make visualization work

Visualization is a powerful tool in sports and business, people that have success visualizing do the following:

* **_Know what they want._**
* **_Get in a relaxed state._**
* **_Visualize getting what they want in a full rich experience (images, sounds, smells, and feelings)._**
* **_Believe and expect to get it._**
* **_Think they deserve it._**

You must believe it will work and imagine fully associatedÂ  (your point of view), images of you achieving your goal, in "the first person". Associated pictures are bigger and more exciting than dissociated ones. There is no right or wrong way of doing it, it is all in your imagination, the most important part is to relax and focus on your breathing, you may fall asleep while doing it, that is fine.

>**Visualizing** is just focusing on a part of your body, for instance, your eyes, and imagining they are shining with a bright color, you can imagine the color intensifying and making a sound.

I recommend trying this at the end of the day, it will help you relax before sleeping. You can listen to this recording when you want to relax; please remove your contacts.

For color, I usually pick a clear blue color and the sound is a buzzing energy sound or the rolling of the ocean, the smell I use can be lavender or fresh grass. You can use anything that you like even classical music, the sound of rain or a Beatles song. Takes time to improve at this but it is a good practice and can help you learn to relax and probably to get you interested in learning meditation later.
