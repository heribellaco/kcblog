Hyperbaric Oxygen therapy
-------------------------

**Hyperbaric oxygen therapy** is the use of oxygen in a controlled high-pressure chamber, this is commonly used when divers have to get out fast of deep waters and experience problems; the blood in their bodies start to produce nitrogen bubbles much like a soda can that is opened after shaken, this can be dangerous.

Founded In 1967 the Under Sea and [_Hyperbaric Medical Society_](https://www.uhms.org/) developed many protocols for the treatment of several diseases.

The pressure applied in the chamber is around 1.5 atmospheres, and this produces that even the plasma starts transporting oxygen; increasing the availability of this important element to the body cells.

The therapy appears to be especially useful for brain health and degenerative conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease because it activates the brain mitochondria to produce more energy.

It is commonly used for diabetic feet because the high oxygenation appears to reduce the time required for wound healing. [Dr. Richard Neubauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_A_Neubauer) one of the pioneers of the technique used to say that the future of neurology is going to be linked to Hyperbaric Medicine.

Usually, the hyperbaric chamber is an acrylic individual bed but there are chambers for 2-5 people at the same time.

#### Preparation for HBOT

The first time you will consult with a doctor that has experience with the process. You will be asked about your prior medical history and probably will do some blood work.

After that initial consultation, you have to tell them what do you expect from the treatment or treatments. Be aware of possible problems like any broken dental filling or sinus congestion that you have, since pressure can exacerbate the issue.

### Experience of hyperbaric oxygen therapy

The experience is not for the nervous or claustrophobic. You will feel a little bit clumsy in the beginning, I was wearing an oxygen mask all the time approximately one hour.

The idea of being trapped for an hour can be hard for some people and sounds illogical until you try it, the experience is similar to flying on a plane to some near city.

What really helped me was to concentrate on my breathing and forget I was trapped in this chamber.

After a few minutes, I started to, recite the yoga's mantra _sat-_nam, sat on inhalation and nam on exhalation and I applied the famous Navy Seal breathing technique of inhaling deeply for a count of six, hold it for a count of two and then exhale for a count of six completely emptying your lungs.

I did this three times and then breathe normally for a minute and then do it all again.

The cost of **HBOT** is not cheap in the U.S. around $150 since very few conditions are covered by medical insurance.

My idea was to make some mental gymnastics while in the chamber, what I noticed was that I remembered things that I had forgotten long ago, as some friend from childhood, and some events in the past that I had no recollection of whatsoever.

>Some people use this technology for prevention purposes, for instance, if you have family members with degenerative conditions you can try this on yourself a couple of times a year or if you have a corneal transplant rejection you could try this to help to avoid the rejection.

Hi, I love to improve myself and others.
