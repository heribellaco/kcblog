### About Keratoconus...Hi There!

My name is Heriberto I was diagnosed with _**keratoconus**_ 20 years ago and have struggled and become very interested in this condition. I have found that when I take proper care of my body, that causes that I feel better, have more energy, and my lens comfort and vision improves.

I have had several different contact lens fittings over the years. What about you? Maybe you are looking for an alternative way of seeing things, if that is true you are in the right place, enjoy and try my ideas and **Welcome!**

### Why this?

My belief is that we can improve our life by bringing more attention to what we do every day, how we treat and take care of our bodies and mind.
