Keratoconus what to do?
-----------------------

Your main objective must be to have an adequate vision for your life needs (study, job, fun).

1.- **Calm down and get informed**. Don't rush things by trying to get rid of the problem immediately.

2.- The first line of treatment is "_**specialty contact lenses**"_. Find a good lens fitter with experience adapting lenses to keratoconus patients.

He or she is usually an O.D. in a big metropolitan area like Chicago or New York, or try a University Ophthalmology Department like UCLA.

In other parts of the world, you can find them on the websites of the companies that made the specialty contact lenses.

### Where to inform yourself

3.- Visit sites like the _[National Keratoconus Foundation](https://www.nkcf.org/),_ they have lots of information, a forum for KC'ers, and by request a list of doctors anywhere in the world.

4.- If you are just diagnosed it is rare that your case is very advanced, I believe you have time to get informed.

Try contact lenses and adapt to your condition, of course, listen to your doctor, I ideally would recommend visiting two doctors.

### A new life-style

5.- **_Relax_**. Your eyes are probably very tired and hurt for years of use and abuse, take a rest and let them heal a little.

Remove your contacts when you want to rest of them and learn to relax your neck and shoulders, try to rest every 30 minutes on the computer.

6.- **_Breathe_**: Related to relaxing is breathing, inhale and raise your belly, try to smile, and yawn every time you can.

Check your posture and the height of your chair and your monitor screen, some minor adjustments can improve relaxation and reduce visual stress.

7.- Take long walks and _**look in the distance**_, looking afar is relaxing, all day looking close to objects or a monitor is harmful to your eyes.

This is just the beginning you can do much more, get my health guide for people with keratoconus on my website:
