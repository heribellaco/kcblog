Covid eye care
--------------

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus strain (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the city of Wuhan, China. Certainly, we that handles contact lens are accustomed to cleaning and washing our hands very thoroughly to avoid coronavirus eye symptoms.

Young adult contact lens wearers have been reported to be more likely to develop eye infections and more likely to have poor contact lens hygiene practices. In short, several risk factors have been identified, including sleeping in lenses, exposing lenses to water, not adhering to replacement schedules, and reusing disinfecting solutions.

### **Coronavirus eye symptoms**

This virus can infect us through our eye’s angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ACE-2 receptors and cause problems. On the other hand, people have reported viral infections of the eyes called "_**[pinkeye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis)"**_ since the beginning of the year. This infection is not severe, it appears that the eye path won’t get you a heavy corona virus case like if you inhaled the droplets by your nose.

There is a strong possibility the virus may contaminate the ocular surface via respiratory droplets after coughing, sneezing, and hand-to-eye contact. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 may cause conjunctivitis, and viral RNA has been detected in tears of COVID-19 patients2.

Based on recent evidence, potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the ocular surface remains a significant concern. The route of transmission and infiltration of the virus within the ocular tissue is still unknown.

It is hard to go to an ophthalmologist to get help, so buy your gear over the internet (solutions, safety glasses, cases, plungers, etc...)

### In conclusion: What to do

>Wear anti-fog safety glasses or protective goggles when out in public transportation and wash and disinfect your hands and lenses every time, also be extra careful to don’t rub or touch your eyes with your hands and use disinfectant gel 70% alcohol every time you touch surfaces outside your home or if you touched the money.
